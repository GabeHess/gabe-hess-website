I"<div class="p">I seized life like a sodden cloth. I wrung,</div>
<div class="p">And wrung, till I could wring no more, but I</div>
<div class="p">Discovered that too few drops I had wrung.</div>
<div class="p">And when I felt the cloth, I found it dry.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">I swam my cloth round in a wooden pail,</div>
<div class="p">Round and around within a porcelain tub,</div>
<div class="p">And hummed a lazy tune, then saw the pail</div>
<div class="p">Was empty, and, so, empty was the tub.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But when I went to wring my sodden cloth,</div>
<div class="p">Too few drops fell, less than when wrung before.</div>
<div class="p">I waxed resentful, doleful, easy, wroth,</div>
<div class="p">But wrung no droplet, not one droplet, more.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Then I grew pensive, and retired to think.</div>
<div class="p">Perpending this new mystery, I found</div>
<div class="p">But broken chain; however, not the link,</div>
<div class="p">Which when I find, I'll spread the news around.</div>
