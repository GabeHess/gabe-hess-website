<div class="p">Pretended feeling, and a feignèd depth</div>
<div class="p">Of woes and passions, make me search my purse:</div>
<div class="p">Whether king-stamped coin has dwelling there,</div>
<div class="p">Or whether coin but counterfeit,</div>
<div class="p">My purpose is to take stock of my ware.</div>
