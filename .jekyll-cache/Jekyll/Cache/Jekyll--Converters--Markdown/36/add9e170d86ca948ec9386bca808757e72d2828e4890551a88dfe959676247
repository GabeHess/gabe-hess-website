I"Ž<div class="p">An icy print on field of snow</div>
<div class="p">Announced the name of gentle doe.</div>
<div class="p">She came to fill the world with light,</div>
<div class="p">The radiance of things to know.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">She did not see his dire plight,</div>
<div class="p">Her master lost to thinking blight.</div>
<div class="p">He thought those things were truly not</div>
<div class="p">Which filled his gaze with Lordly sight.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The soil was for sure his lot</div>
<div class="p">And in its grasp he'd surely rot.</div>
<div class="p">Or so it seemed to man divine,</div>
<div class="p">The child of a swamp grown hot.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He is a knave who trusts his wine,</div>
<div class="p">The fruit of God's well-tended vine.</div>
<div class="p">He is a fool indeed for whom</div>
<div class="p">The world is insufficient sign.</div>
