I"U<div class="p">The crest of glory did little men support,</div>
<div class="p">Who thrown to heaven fumbled for a bauble</div>
<div class="p">Ta'en thence for passport, when in this parlous sport,</div>
<div class="p">The providential plume began to wobble.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">As with a tremble, a wave dies on a reef,</div>
<div class="p">As birds of feather molt their headdresses;</div>
<div class="p">So on the very top summit of belief,</div>
<div class="p">Men lose nerve, and repent their excesses;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">At doubt's percussion, the sacred edifice,</div>
<div class="p">When lines run thither, as through stone blocks white</div>
<div class="p">The wavy cracks flee before the hammer's kiss,</div>
<div class="p">From Zenith falls t' Antipodes of night.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">One man a fetish, for luck's protection, snatched,</div>
<div class="p">The wave espoused a second gloomy soul,</div>
<div class="p">From thence a third soul plunged with visage wretched,</div>
<div class="p">Straight to the opposite infernal pole.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Still the crest tumbled, and eddied at the base,</div>
<div class="p">Where souls were tossed and tickled in the wash,</div>
<div class="p">And fall'n from glory to this low swilling place—</div>
<div class="p">In clamant waters' cruel chaos slosh.</div>
