I"É<div class="p">The bitter seed of the pomegranate,</div>
<div class="p">Engirted with red, a glorious sight,</div>
<div class="p">With crystal complexion, flushÃ¨d with light,</div>
<div class="p">With a bitter half-crunch, and a spurt of delight,</div>
<div class="p">A long passion sated.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The flesh of the seed (when the rind of the fruit</div>
<div class="p">Has broke into halves with a glorious sound)</div>
<div class="p">Is a nectarous feast for my sore throat profound</div>
<div class="p">That paucities through toward this surfeit was bound,</div>
<div class="p">As were it thus fated.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">In the wake of the glut, there I, spattered with red,</div>
<div class="p">Whimper over the feast that left open the door</div>
<div class="p">To a junket of fruits I deplete more and more,</div>
<div class="p">While in absolute measure most foods I abhor</div>
<div class="p">That for dinner are slated.</div>
