<p>6/14/2020: Lest the circumstances that occasioned this satire be forgotten, I have included an explanatory note at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî</p>

<div class="p">Let observation, with a six-foot lens,</div>
<div class="p">A growing lens, a growing, lying lens,</div>
<div class="p">Survey the globe from L.A. to New York,</div>
<div class="p">Then yield to pressure, popping like a cork.</div>
<div class="p">Remark one incident of local hate,</div>
<div class="p">Pick out the tidbit that o'erthrew the state.</div>
<div class="p">Then watch the riots and the flames commence,</div>
<div class="p">And sift the rubble for a scrap of sense.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ordinary course of all the world</div>
<div class="p">For ages yet unfurled, and still unfurled.</div>
<div class="p">The clock ticked on, the stars observed their course,</div>
<div class="p">The planets moved by an invisible force.</div>
<div class="p">For ages interrupted but by war</div>
<div class="p">And famine, the affairs of earth grew hoar.</div>
<div class="p">The farmers farmed, the bankers banked, the sun</div>
<div class="p">On all alike shone, all and everyone.</div>
<div class="p">Unmoved by lovers' sighs, by death, by birth,</div>
<div class="p">By fire, water, anger, sorrow, mirth,</div>
<div class="p">By toil, celebration, leisure, strife,</div>
<div class="p">Unmoved by the events of human life;</div>
<div class="p">Through all, the pace continued and the sun</div>
<div class="p">On all alike shone, all and everyone.</div>
<div class="p">Still merchants bartered in the marketplace,</div>
<div class="p">And transport carried men from place to place.</div>
<div class="p">Still rivals fought, and men of honor dueled,</div>
<div class="p">And richborn sons went great ways to be schooled.</div>
<div class="p">Still crops did grow, geese honked, and sheep did baa,</div>
<div class="p">And peasant girls went singing la, la, la.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When lo! hold course! ho, ho! good heavens, stand,</div>
<div class="p">Or stop‚Äîwhatever‚Äîwind it back, there! and</div>
<div class="p">A solitary incident of hate</div>
<div class="p">O'erturns the steady course of human fate!</div>
<div class="p">The clockwork breaks, the earth is winding down,</div>
<div class="p">The sun! the sun! does menacingly frown!</div>
<div class="p">All commerce ceases, birds daren't make a sound,</div>
<div class="p">Here law and order flee to higher ground.</div>
<div class="p">A tragedy has happened, never seen;</div>
<div class="p">Who knew that tragedy had ever been?</div>
<div class="p">And now the warriors, hiding in their homes,</div>
<div class="p">Crawl out, like Grecian gods, and, oh, the groans,</div>
<div class="p">The mourning, tears, compassion, selfless love,</div>
<div class="p">A sight to maze divinities above!</div>
<div class="p">But leave the mourners, stoop, observe the troops,</div>
<div class="p">The brigands roving in self-righteous groups.</div>
<div class="p">Together they confer, together find</div>
<div class="p">That wrong for wrong must be, and kind for kind.</div>
<div class="p">"One man is dead," conclude the many few;</div>
<div class="p">"Now think, consider, what is there to do."</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here pipes a voice: "Come, listen to me, brothers,</div>
<div class="p">There is no us and them, or we and others;</div>
<div class="p">Therefore, the world is polar: cause on cause:</div>
<div class="p">And we must win our share of due applause.</div>
<div class="p">Now think, heed not the heart, obey the head.</div>
<div class="p">Th' occasion of our anguish? One man dead.</div>
<div class="p">Th' answer that rings across th' entire nation?</div>
<div class="p">Complete and universal condemnation.</div>
<div class="p">One man is dead? Burn, pillage, loot, and roar‚Äî</div>
<div class="p">A single death is cause for global war!</div>
<div class="p">All have condemned the murderer, none applaud</div>
<div class="p">By history's register of hatred awed?</div>
<div class="p">No matter! nothing matters but the cause</div>
<div class="p">And winning our allotment of applause.</div>
<div class="p">Ye warriors! fearless, dauntless, brave, and strong,</div>
<div class="p">Angels of light, and banishers of wrong‚Äî</div>
<div class="p">A man has killed! One dead! And all condemn</div>
<div class="p">The murderer! Kill, burn, loot, catch history's hem</div>
<div class="p">And ride to glory‚Äîscruple not, the time</div>
<div class="p">Has come when nothing's counted as a crime!</div>
<div class="p">No scruples, not the time, no frets or qualms,</div>
<div class="p">No conscience, or misgivings, prayers or psalms.</div>
<div class="p">For right is with us, and the tide is ours;</div>
<div class="p">Smell chaos‚Äîtaste it!‚Äîcoming on the hours.</div>
<div class="p">We know that hate is truly universal!</div>
<div class="p">One man is dead! One's killed! Oh, what reversal</div>
<div class="p">Is this? Now all the progress we had made</div>
<div class="p">Is swept away. Our dreams and visions fade!</div>
<div class="p">But now's the hour! Contend against, and kill‚Äî</div>
<div class="p">And all the future will be what we will.</div>
<div class="p">Consider, brothers, nothing of this sort</div>
<div class="p">Has ever reached our ears by swift report.</div>
<div class="p">Outrage, anguish, outrage, oh, the pain!</div>
<div class="p">It hurts! it hurts! the knife goes in again!</div>
<div class="p">My brothers! one injunction! do your part‚Äî</div>
<div class="p">Burn, kill, loot, pillage, tear out from the heart</div>
<div class="p">This evil root, for evil once it's gone,</div>
<div class="p">Will be no more‚Äîcome, come Armageddon!</div>
<div class="p">Speak, brothers! We are outraged, we are just,</div>
<div class="p">We are anguished, and for violence lust.</div>
<div class="p">We speak for the oppress√®d and the poor.</div>
<div class="p">We are outraged! We can bear no more!"</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The speaker speaks, and faints into the arms</div>
<div class="p">Of comrades, anguished; "Brothers, take to arms,"</div>
<div class="p">He moans before he swoons; a brother loud</div>
<div class="p">"All true and to the point" cries to the crowd.</div>
<div class="p">Then turn the mob, and leave their brother there,</div>
<div class="p">And of applause go forth to seek their share.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They loot, they riot, howl, and waylay;</div>
<div class="p">They burn the cities under light of day.</div>
<div class="p">One man is dead! Thus all will pay the price:</div>
<div class="p">The time is past for brothers to be nice.</div>
<div class="p">With each new conquest, each new righteous cause,</div>
<div class="p">They turn, stampede, and seek more social flaws.</div>
<div class="p">Behind them many suffer, many howl,</div>
<div class="p">And curse the day that brought these ominous fowl.</div>
<div class="p">With livelihoods destroyed, the few lament;</div>
<div class="p">The many coo, proud of their good intent.</div>
<div class="p">'Tis just that some should suffer for the cause.</div>
<div class="p">How can they not join in the just applause?</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With stony hearts, they burn, and leave behind,</div>
<div class="p">With no regard for anguish left behind.</div>
<div class="p">They've burnt the livelihood of many, but</div>
<div class="p">These should rejoice for their part in the glut.</div>
<div class="p">These owners come, and see the damage; they</div>
<div class="p">Had spent their lives in saving for the day:</div>
<div class="p">Their dreams were realized, all was coming true,</div>
<div class="p">When lo! the looters then were coming through.</div>
<div class="p">Another worked his way from poverty,</div>
<div class="p">Aspiring toward receipt of property;</div>
<div class="p">To low condition born, he ne'er gave up,</div>
<div class="p">But then! the mob came and the flames went up.</div>
<div class="p">Another saved a penny at a time,</div>
<div class="p">And worked‚Äîbut all was burnt up in good time.</div>
<div class="p">See justice done! see high ideals realized!</div>
<div class="p">What noble souls have burnt homes to the skies.</div>
<div class="p">A fair and just society they seek</div>
<div class="p">While flames go up and they destruction wreak.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rioters trample o'er the fresh-dug grave,</div>
<div class="p">Of one poor man, unjustly killed, "who gave</div>
<div class="p">His life to social justice," turning death</div>
<div class="p">Into a cause, and hate a shibboleth,</div>
<div class="p">And tragedy into a common trick:</div>
<div class="p">And one man's death becomes realpolitik.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While cities burn, the ethical who stand</div>
<div class="p">Look on approving, praise the violent band.</div>
<div class="p">These caring citizens who care aright</div>
<div class="p">Cry raindrop tears, and smile with delight.</div>
<div class="p">The ethical, too good, too right, to care</div>
<div class="p">If few must suffer for the future, air</div>
<div class="p">Their orthodoxy on the point of race,</div>
<div class="p">And their approval of th' entire case.</div>
<div class="p">They sigh and sob, and rally and retire,</div>
<div class="p">They moan, they cry, berate, and they perspire;</div>
<div class="p">Approve, and clap, and preen, and pout, and post‚Äî</div>
<div class="p">The Ethical commands a numerous host!</div>
<div class="p">Barometers of pain across the nation</div>
<div class="p">Indulge collective grief and lamentation.</div>
<div class="p">Then when the pain subsides, they rally and</div>
<div class="p">They spread the color through th' entire land.</div>
<div class="p">The color of their sorrow and their grief,</div>
<div class="p">The color of those who deserve relief,</div>
<div class="p">The color draping o'er the enemy's soul,</div>
<div class="p">The color of the void, (and filthy coal),</div>
<div class="p">Descends and day becomes the darkest night</div>
<div class="p">As oecumenic darkness blots out light.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ethical repose, well satisfied</div>
<div class="p">Of all they've done across the nation wide.</div>
<div class="p">They've voiced their anguish, made a difference, and</div>
<div class="p">Spread devastation through th' entire land.</div>

<p>6/14/2020: On May 25, 2020, Memorial Day, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a white police officer named Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of a 46 year old black man named George Floyd for eight minutes and forty-six seconds. Three fellow police officers aided and abetted the action, which ended in the death of George Floyd. The circumstances of the case were such that, in short, the entire country found cause to condemn the incident as self-evidently wrong.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, members of the radical left insisted that this solitary incident of ‚Äúpolice brutality‚Äù was not only racially motivated (it may have been, but there was no evidence for it), it was a mere instance of the ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù that pervades the entire police force and the entire country. There was nationwide protesting perhaps out of proportion to the circumstances. But this protesting, being peaceful, was relatively unobjectionable. However, there was also rioting across the nation. Cities were burnt, communities torn apart, businesses (many of them owned by black citizens) looted, statues and memorials vandalized and torn down, and so forth. People were killed. Homicides and crime skyrocketed. Police officers were injured and vilified across the nation. Mob rule was instituted in some areas. Private citizens were forced to defend their businesses and communities with guns. Many Democrat leaders in big cities refused to take control of the situation.</p>

<p>But all this would be less remarkable, were it not that ordinary people, such as we all know, lent verbal support to some of the most wanton excesses of this would-be reign of terror. They insisted that attacking police officers and burning cities is not violence, that mob rule is empowering to black communities, that the police must be defunded immediately, that anyone who does not agree with them politically is racist and evil, and so forth. They affected outrage and anguish over the death of George Floyd, to advance their own political ends and, primarily, to display to the world their own supereminent righteousness and right-thinking. At times, they seemed to glory in the violence, destruction, and atmosphere of animosity.</p>

<p>On June 02, many day-to-day leftists took to Instagram to air their purity of heart, by posting a picture of a blacked out screen, with the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday. The day was set aside for African Americans to raise their voices and speak out. Whites, meanwhile, were to listen silently, with abject contrition. This shameless display of self-righteousness was not the end of the left‚Äôs antics. Since then, leftists have been busy posting messages to social media, to the effect that anyone who disagrees with them politically should unfollow them. Many have knelt for eight minutes and forty-six seconds, in memory of George Floyd ostensibly, but really to display their own political virtue. Anyone, of course, who has not posted to social media with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has come under question, and many who have refused to kneel have been vilified and ostracized.</p>

<p>Before all this, the nation had been under lockdown on account of the covid-19 virus. Although the radical left was rabid in its support of the lockdown, it suddenly became the case, once the protesting began, that the virus was no longer a material concern.</p>

<p>I have focused on the aspects of the case most relevant to this satire. Since June 02, and before it, and on it, much insanity has issued from the mouths and hands of the radical left, which could hardly be encapsulated in this short explanatory note.</p>
