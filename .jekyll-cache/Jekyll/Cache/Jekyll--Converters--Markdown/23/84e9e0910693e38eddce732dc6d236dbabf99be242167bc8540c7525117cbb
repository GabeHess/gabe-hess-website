I"‚<div class="p">I knew a man who seemed to know</div>
<div class="p">That knowledge is but of the age</div>
<div class="p">That brought it to the light and then</div>
<div class="p">Condemned it to the public stage.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He said that virtue was a thing</div>
<div class="p">Arisen from the time of day,</div>
<div class="p">The mood of man who called it his,</div>
<div class="p">No greater than a public play.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">To common thought he gave his mind;</div>
<div class="p">He followed every idle clause;</div>
<div class="p">He did its bidding then withdrew,</div>
<div class="p">And reveled in his due applause.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He pledged his life to any thing</div>
<div class="p">Which to his fancy chanced to call.</div>
<div class="p">And so he lived in anguish deep,</div>
<div class="p">Waiting for the curtain's fall.</div>
