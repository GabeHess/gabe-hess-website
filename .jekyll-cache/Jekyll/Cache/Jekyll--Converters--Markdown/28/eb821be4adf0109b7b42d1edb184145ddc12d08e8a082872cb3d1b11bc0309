I"H<div class="p">A man, distraught, had drawn the form of vice,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had fit it to his figure, mocked his frame.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He now beshrewed the tenants of the map.</div>
<div class="p">He eyed the trelliswork of hateful dice:</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These had pursued their acrobatic game,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compounding had ensured his present hap.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He was beheld where passed the passersby,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There planted to entreat the passing pouch</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To stay its hurry, loose its cord, and give.</div>
<div class="p">In asking humble, still he'd fain defy</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pinpricked orbs which had forborne to vouch</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In him the means to by his labor live.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Rebelling â€™gainst the edicts of the earth,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which with sub-earthly rumblings had beset</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His silk-girt substance with all base travail,</div>
<div class="p">He vowed to profit from another birth,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By foreign industry devised and let,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by his foes against his foe prevail.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">As he thus raged against his almoner,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He contemplated how he'd gain reverse,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And living see his patrons on the street,</div>
<div class="p">And bathe in milk, sweet honey, scented myrrh,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His sometime patrons scorn with lib'ral purseâ€”</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, ah! how lovely, purple, and how meet!</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The world, â€™the while, told in his wealthy foes,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cast coin in small denominations â€™pon</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His rag-clad body, but its eyes kept from</div>
<div class="p">That cankered frame of rot, welts, and flyblows,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with disgust ungen'rous hurried on</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With poise unearned to â€™gain the mislaid crumb.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">As flush and easy patrons turned away</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To well remark the industry of vice,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its diligence in gath'ring its reward,</div>
<div class="p">A humble man perceived a soul astray,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perceived a man who'd failed to bolt out vice:</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave, and kept no momentary hoard.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">This man took pity on a fellow man,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assuaged his hunger with a loaf of bread;</div>
<div class="p">Perhaps increased his other appetiteâ€”</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus once for twice this man his brother fed.</div>
