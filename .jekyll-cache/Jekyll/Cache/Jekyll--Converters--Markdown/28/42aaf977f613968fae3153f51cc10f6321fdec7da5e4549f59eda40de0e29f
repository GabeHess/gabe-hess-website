I"ˆ<div class="p">A poet I would gladly be</div>
<div class="p">If such were wished by fortune kind.</div>
<div class="p">I am instead a dealer of</div>
<div class="p">Broken verse and half-baked rhymes.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">With athletes I would battle for</div>
<div class="p">The shiny medal round the neck,</div>
<div class="p">If broken bones I did not fear</div>
<div class="p">And wasted time did not respect.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Philosophy will claim me when</div>
<div class="p">Philosophy does sate my soul:</div>
<div class="p">Ambition will not want me then;</div>
<div class="p">Will fire cede to burning coal.</div>
