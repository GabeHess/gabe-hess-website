I"<div class="p">I met a trav’ler from a distant land:</div>
<div class="p">His talk was spread as golden butter on</div>
<div class="p">Cloud clust’ring bread: a boyish whimsy fanned;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">And gazing on his golden broad face tanned,</div>
<div class="p">His gust young list’ners merrily would don</div>
<div class="p">Before the tales by such nice people banned.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He spoke of Buddhas, rice, indigence, tea;</div>
<div class="p">Beating drums; broken skulls; the raging sea;</div>
<div class="p">Gaelic warriors in traditional dress;</div>
<div class="p">British saints who’d die but ne’er confess;</div>
<div class="p">Sunken ships lain at last in graves unknown;</div>
<div class="p">Regions of cotton and tobacco grown;</div>
<div class="p">Lands between rivers; irrigated banks;</div>
<div class="p">Pilgrims over corn gladly off’ring thanks;</div>
<div class="p">Ziggurats and temples, terraced and tiered;</div>
<div class="p">Strange nocturnal shadows villagers feared;</div>
<div class="p">Vanishing islands of knowledge unmatched;</div>
<div class="p">Timber huts with flaming roofs of straw thatched;</div>
<div class="p">Armies sunk deep in Serbonian bogs;</div>
<div class="p">And leopards at their masters’ feet like dogs.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">This man was soon dispelled by local thugs,</div>
<div class="p">Correct in all they ever did or said;</div>
<div class="p">And magic carpets, oriental rugs,</div>
<div class="p">Were still before slag, to innocence fed.</div>
