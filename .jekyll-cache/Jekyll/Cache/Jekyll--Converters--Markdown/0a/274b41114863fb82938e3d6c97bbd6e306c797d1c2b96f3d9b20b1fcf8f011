I"„<div class="p">God stood judge over the disordered world:</div>
<div class="p">The world in native anarchy was swirled</div>
<div class="p">Into confusion by the Devil's pencil,</div>
<div class="p">A grave adventure with a great expense still:</div>
<div class="p">The little men stood by, jeered, and guffawed</div>
<div class="p">That two companions could be so abroad</div>
<div class="p">As to, embracing, think their souls are one,</div>
<div class="p">When ciphers doubled still amount to none.</div>
<div class="p">They clung together, though, in single love,</div>
<div class="p">And God did their pure, loving souls approve.</div>
<div class="p">Then though the wrack of all things strew the ground,</div>
<div class="p">Though doomsday prophets saying nay surroundâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Impossible! impossible! they cryâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Let us to Father's loving law reply.</div>
