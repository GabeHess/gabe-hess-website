I"<div class="p">If Webster had but known the fate</div>
<div class="p">Of language lost to languid man,</div>
<div class="p">He would have wept or wailed or sobbedâ€”</div>
<div class="p">A lamentation well-bemoaned.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">A capillary he'd soon behold</div>
<div class="p">Fused to trunk of iron, sound;</div>
<div class="p">With pride consigned to rancid pool</div>
<div class="p">Or sealed at last in mournful mound.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">If science has dimensions full,</div>
<div class="p">Abundant paths through sombre space,</div>
<div class="p">Yet Noah hath before him now</div>
<div class="p">No more than frills and threadbare lace.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The glory of a greater Thing</div>
<div class="p">Can beg no words from jaded man,</div>
<div class="p">For words one can not well supply</div>
<div class="p">When words bestride a peasant's throne.</div>
