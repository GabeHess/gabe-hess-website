I" <div class="p">In 2016 eyes a little puffed,</div>
<div class="p">As had red pillows under each been stuffed,</div>
<div class="p">As softest pillows that the morning through</div>
<div class="p">Received the misty storms and plaints that blew;</div>
<div class="p">And slight still tremors in the lines of face;</div>
<div class="p">And sympathetic shoulders that embrace,</div>
<div class="p">When tremors mount, the inundated fonts</div>
<div class="p">That bathe the passage of our Renaissanceâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Confess some tragic hap has conquered late</div>
<div class="p">The theretofore congenial course of fate.</div>
<div class="p">Presiding over visages of chalk,</div>
<div class="p">Still brows confess self-disbelieving shock,</div>
<div class="p">And safety pins instruct the tempest-tost</div>
<div class="p">That nature's feelings are not wholly lost.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 2020, more most violent brows</div>
<div class="p">Arch over lips pronouncing drastic vows,</div>
<div class="p">And warrior-tones cry out from every breast,</div>
<div class="p">For safety pins this time too much distressed.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stay, wanton gods, a moment on the height</div>
<div class="p">Of proud Olympus to affect my sight:</div>
<div class="p">Who great on earth has power, tell, to assuage</div>
<div class="p">This steady flow of mingled grief and rage?</div>
<div class="p">Who can ensconce the wound that venom seeps,</div>
<div class="p">Or raise its valleys, till the victim sleeps,</div>
<div class="p">Or raze high places on the purple wound,</div>
<div class="p">And cultivate spring gardens that abound?</div>
<div class="p">But on the rugged rocks, a poor terrain,</div>
<div class="p">Behold affects' belligerent campaign;</div>
<div class="p">And lone souls standing in the rooted garden,</div>
<div class="p">And in war's arms, are by a devil ridden!</div>
<div class="p">Would honest readers know the cause? Take note:</div>
<div class="p">It seems the poor souls lost another vote.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A safety pin! No, goodness, not this timeâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Strike safety pins from this most martial rhyme!</div>
<div class="p">This time the righteous spot by their vain pace,</div>
<div class="p">Their flushed complexion, wild eyes, charnel face</div>
<div class="p">Filled with the rotten corpse of twice snuffed hope</div>
<div class="p">That perished when they twice preferred this dope.</div>
<div class="p">As zealous wasps stings visit on a guest</div>
<div class="p">Who chanced to stray near their wood-pulpy nest,</div>
<div class="p">As maenads flock with fine destroying hands</div>
<div class="p">To rend their households as their god demands,</div>
<div class="p">As flinty geese do euthanize their kind,</div>
<div class="p">So do these devils dance, souls intertwined.</div>
<div class="p">And as the crazy French ne'er stoop to drink</div>
<div class="p">The curding blood in the arterial sink</div>
<div class="p">Of worldly streets do these mad devils dance,</div>
<div class="p">Dance in the square, upon the vast expanse</div>
<div class="p">Of their destruction, with blue ghoulish lips,</div>
<div class="p">Lashed on by little hellish wounds and whips.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What temper, temper! brooks the winning sideâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Which must at least be given to deride!</div>
<div class="p">So from convenient nook observe the terror</div>
<div class="p">Of frantic millions rollicking in error.</div>
<div class="p">Cluck, tsk, and chideâ€”restrain a chuckle high</div>
<div class="p">That mounts the throat and threatens to deny</div>
<div class="p">Fools dignityâ€”then rub your hands and gloat:</div>
<div class="p">We won the White House, for we won the vote.</div>
