I"›<div class="p">Her manner, it was often said,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was more than not irregular:</div>
<div class="p">She'd ne'er insure her fortune-stake</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By tipping pansies on a purr.</div>
<div class="p">When aura of the gloomy day</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would the oppressÃ¨d frown commend</div>
<div class="p">Her lips would curl around a song,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfeigned in sooth, not there to mend.</div>
<div class="p">But as good hap would by and by</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reveal day's brackets of the mouth,</div>
<div class="p">The outmost limits of her lips</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conjoined in pace would plumb the South.</div>
<div class="p">Old Mason-Dixon would define</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The southern limits of the fall,</div>
<div class="p">Arrange upon a neutral line</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A line to quell the line of Gaul.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">As spoons upset the proudest lookâ€”</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They turn the features overboardâ€”</div>
<div class="p">So she, upending, would renew</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For left and right the right accord.</div>
<div class="p">Two buckets dangled in a well</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must sink or rise but e'er defy</div>
<div class="p">All touch, for by inverted fate</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They can but meet in passing by.</div>
<div class="p">She, like a spoon, or like a pail,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would mirror notions of the day;</div>
<div class="p">Expressing vigor of dissent,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perturb the victims of decay.</div>
<div class="p">She was perhaps no reed but oak,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too brittle,	â€™faith, too staunch, too strong;</div>
<div class="p">But O how good, when â€™round beset,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hide unyielding to the throng!</div>
