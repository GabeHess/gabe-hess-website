I"ç<div class="p">His manner, it  was often said,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was more than not irregular:</div>
<div class="p">He'd ne'er insure his fortune-stake</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By tipping pansies on a purr.</div>
<div class="p">When aura of the gloomy day</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would the oppress√®d frown commend</div>
<div class="p">His lips would curl around a song,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfeigned in sooth, not there to mend.</div>
<div class="p">But as good hap would by and by</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reveal the brackets of the mouth,</div>
<div class="p">His spoonlike lips, the other pail,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conjoined in pace would plumb the South.</div>
<div class="p">Close by they said that this was that,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or that this was what this was not,</div>
<div class="p">P'r'aps that that this was was unfair,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or still again was ill-begot.</div>
<div class="p">But he who knew it was not so</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bore still his faith that life was hard‚Äî</div>
<div class="p">This none could warp by artifice,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or with flung pebbles hence retard.</div>
<div class="p">He was perhaps no reed but oak,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too brittle, ‚Äôfaith, too staunch, too firm;</div>
<div class="p">But as he said in constant hail,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He'd fain wear a stiff epiderm.</div>
