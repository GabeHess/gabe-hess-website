I"ÈG<div class="p">As often happens in the course of things,</div>
<div class="p">Two moderns in their urban wanderings</div>
<div class="p">Wound up together in a coffee shop;</div>
<div class="p">One was a lady; th' other was a fop.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On short acquaintance they began to talk.</div>
<div class="p">An old barista come in from his walk</div>
<div class="p">Saw them in rapt and earnest conversation</div>
<div class="p">In chair by chair, and listened from his station.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lady spoke: 'So 'tis. But still I'd say</div>
<div class="p">If they'd repel th' advancing light of day,</div>
<div class="p">And spurn the sun e'en as it burns o'erhead,</div>
<div class="p">The truth had better knock them on the head.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In short,' the boy replied, 'would fools conspire</div>
<div class="p">To keep their coxcombs from th' insatiate fire?</div>
<div class="p">Would wise men's shoulders shrug, command a height,</div>
<div class="p">Then plunge precipitately at the sight?</div>
<div class="p">Would prophets, staring when kings flout their words,</div>
<div class="p">Address their jeremiads to the birds?</div>
<div class="p">Would Cambridge fellows, swollen Oxford dons</div>
<div class="p">See British Isles overrun with 'rons?</div>
<div class="p">And never lecture, split a hair, or curse</div>
<div class="p">The barbaric tribe in Middle English verse?</div>
<div class="p">Why then should weâ€”for modesty let's say</div>
<div class="p">Not we, not us, but rather them and theyâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Why then should they, th' enlightened few, relent</div>
<div class="p">And see th' ignorant mass gain its intent?</div>
<div class="p">The mob its interest cries, but what results?</div>
<div class="p">The mob its interest gains; the mob exults.</div>
<div class="p">But will the interest false eclipse the true</div>
<div class="p">Whene'er the many overrule the few.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''Tis so,' spoke she, 'but passion is the sand,</div>
<div class="p">On which foundation rears the hasty hand,</div>
<div class="p">Which grasps above it Ruinâ€”and the sprout</div>
<div class="p">Stands firmly through the sandstorm and the drought;</div>
<div class="p">These crack the base, attenuate the limb,</div>
<div class="p">But still the jutting monument stands grim,</div>
<div class="p">With Ruin clutched above the seething clouds,</div>
<div class="p">Serenely unaware of th' angry crowds</div>
<div class="p">That gather at her base. Does all conspire</div>
<div class="p">To have her down, in flames to bear her higher?</div>
<div class="p">Strange figure! But the mob will be obeyed,</div>
<div class="p">The course of History will not be stayed;</div>
<div class="p">And I had rather, with a subtle force,</div>
<div class="p">Switch mob and History to another course,</div>
<div class="p">Than dam them both, and see the banks o'erspill,</div>
<div class="p">Then see the Future dare affront my will.</div>
<div class="p">Besides, what is a mob? Th' illiterate</div>
<div class="p">Concourse does not affront the literate:</div>
<div class="p">We see, and pity, the assembled flocks,</div>
<div class="p">Then legislate their way, laws and <em>Bostock's</em>.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Nay, even so,' said he, 'I must insist,</div>
<div class="p">Are we to countenance that they exist?</div>
<div class="p">While mobs obstruct the March of Progress, dreams</div>
<div class="p">Belong to night, unrealized in day's schemes.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A just concern. No fear, the time is nigh,</div>
<div class="p">The stage is set, the halter swings on high.</div>
<div class="p">I understand impatience, but our thirst</div>
<div class="p">Will soon be whetted, bodies soon immersed.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What joy! what rapture! in the boy displayed;</div>
<div class="p">He leaped a little leap, then knelt, then prayed,</div>
<div class="p">Then paused, brow furrowed, dropped his hands, and spoke:</div>
<div class="p">'What is our program once the world is woke?</div>
<div class="p">Th' inexorable flight of airborne Fate,</div>
<div class="p">Who sees, without distortion, the whole state,</div>
<div class="p">Pulls in its tow some dreamwork for the Future,</div>
<div class="p">Synthetic stuff that will the world accouter.</div>
<div class="p">What is it? Cotton clouds, and sunset skies,</div>
<div class="p">Rainbow rays, and little whispered lies?</div>
<div class="p">What is it? Tell, pray tell, what program comes</div>
<div class="p">On clouds of glory, strewing sugarplums?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Your thirst is virtuous; therefore, I tell;</div>
<div class="p">Be warned that man can hardly fathom Hell;</div>
<div class="p">How then presume t' invade the sphere of Heaven?</div>
<div class="p">Be, puny man, content with what is given!</div>
<div class="p">Here feel the waft of raptures on the wing;</div>
<div class="p">Here steal a note from songs that Sirens sing;</div>
<div class="p">There touch a quadrant of infinity.</div>
<div class="p">And with these glimpses, man, contented be!</div>
<div class="p">Kind Future will reveal not all he knows,</div>
<div class="p">Conceal from man new glory, banished woes.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Tell, tell,' he pleaded, 'and my cup of joy</div>
<div class="p">Brims o'er. What will we build? And what destroy?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'First item: History must be o'erthrown,</div>
<div class="p">Be seen prostrate at Future's splendid throne.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But surely not,' said he, 'all History</div>
<div class="p">Is cursed with irredeemability?</div>
<div class="p">At times we can concede, at times admit,</div>
<div class="p">That Error probed for Truth and gained not it;</div>
<div class="p">But then some mortal, more endowed by Fate,</div>
<div class="p">Broke through the crust and filled his empty plate</div>
<div class="p">With vegetables of knowledge; and the meat</div>
<div class="p">Was only set when Bacon took his seat.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'True, but the next point you anticipate.</div>
<div class="p">All carnivores have broccoli on their plate;</div>
<div class="p">And kale, and smoothies, salads, and a goo</div>
<div class="p">Coagulated that we call tofu.</div>
<div class="p">Yes, troglodytes! Behold your chickens taken,</div>
<div class="p">Your beef and bird, your sausage and your bacon!</div>
<div class="p">But most of all, behold! your bloody steak</div>
<div class="p">Torn from the rib, we'll not forbear to take.</div>
<div class="p">Think you (think they), we still have curds and whey:</div>
<div class="p">Our milk and cheese: and still our staunch <em>poulet</em></div>
<div class="p">Lay eggs appropriated by rapine,</div>
<div class="p">While chickens cluck out, "Hey, but that was mine!"</div>
<div class="p">Think you, and if they raid the larder, and</div>
<div class="p">Remove the butter, if they seize our land</div>
<div class="p">(Wise foresight) still the bee house will be ours,</div>
<div class="p">And still the honey chivvied from the flowers.</div>
<div class="p">Deluded fools! We'll take your honeycombs</div>
<div class="p">And have agave in your rural homes.</div>
<div class="p">Be warned: exploit the labor of the bees,</div>
<div class="p">Next thing the buggers will be franchisees!</div>
<div class="p">The land will flow with honey apple-based</div>
<div class="p">And milk of almonds that mislead the taste.</div>
<div class="p">And all will see a vegan life is grand:</div>
<div class="p">We munch on fruit, chew nuts, and hug the land.</div>
<div class="p">Six salads down at intervals we eat</div>
<div class="p">Throughout the day, and mow down fields of wheat.</div>
<div class="p">With valor we confront an apple stand:</div>
<div class="p">"We'll take the lot!" with valor we demand.</div>
<div class="p">We substitute our products with the ease</div>
<div class="p">That comes of practice; (and we rescue fleas,</div>
<div class="p">Who must be rehabilitated in</div>
<div class="p">Polite society; don't turn us in).</div>
<div class="p">We munch all day! rise three times in the night!</div>
<div class="p">And crop the grass, to keep our brothers' right.</div>
<div class="p">Let all on earth abide in harmony,</div>
<div class="p">Cow, pig, duck, rabbit, oyster, bat, man, bee.</div>
<div class="p">Until we recognize the rights of fishes</div>
<div class="p">No man will think himself secure from dishes.</div>
<div class="p">As long as one fowl in the world is eaten</div>
<div class="p">Man is in chains, no rights, and daily beaten.</div>
<div class="p">For turkey rights are human rights; till we</div>
<div class="p">Rise, with one voice say, "I am a turkey,"</div>
<div class="p">And as a free man, "<em>Civis agri sum</em>,"</div>
<div class="p">All free men are enslavedâ€”though ask not whom.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But what,' cried he, 'what if they hunt a deer?</div>
<div class="p">Assuage my mind, annihilate my fear.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We'll take their weapons, fool; we'll take their guns,</div>
<div class="p">Their ARs, pistols, rifles, and shotguns;</div>
<div class="p">Their slingshots, crossbows; tanks, grenades, and bombs;</div>
<div class="p">Their tomahawks, their forked sticks, and tom toms;</div>
<div class="p">Their harquebuses; shrapnel; Bowie knives;</div>
<div class="p">Their swords, their nunchuks, rope darts; and their wives.</div>
<div class="p">Then when they are disarmed, with winning smiles</div>
<div class="p">We'll introduce a plan of Ray Kurzweil's.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Bully!' cried the boy, 'What then, what then? what then?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We'll then exterminate the race of men!'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Is that essential?' said the boy, whose crest,</div>
<div class="p">Now drooped, defeathered, rested on his breast.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''Tis of the essence,' was the prompt reply,</div>
<div class="p">'Come, listen, and I'll show the reason why.</div>
<div class="p">Since History began the masculine race</div>
<div class="p">Has washed with blood the globe's impeccant face,</div>
<div class="p">Has dragged his mate round and round by the hair,</div>
<div class="p">And sallied forth to take another's lair,</div>
<div class="p">Then to his own returned, intent to mope,</div>
<div class="p">While she his one true mutters, "What a dope."</div>
<div class="p">All evil in the world is caused by him,</div>
<div class="p">Descending to his heirs by patronym.</div>
<div class="p">His bloody steak he'll have, on her enforce,</div>
<div class="p">Who would almost for such a cause divorce.</div>
<div class="p">His wars he'll fight, the curst imperialist!</div>
<div class="p">His noble wife fights bigots with a fist.</div>
<div class="p">She knows her comrades by phylactery:</div>
<div class="p">They undermine her husband's victory.</div>
<div class="p">The plans go round; the preparations made,</div>
<div class="p">Her husband's ribs release the glinting blade.</div>
<div class="p">The virtuous widow, with red on the belly,</div>
<div class="p">Black all o'er, this modern Machiavelli,</div>
<div class="p">Wipes clean the blade, and spins her late love's shroud,
<div class="p">While neighbors whisper, "Strange, they never rowed."
<div class="p">But when her husband is a lamb, obeying,</div>
<div class="p">Who spins the plot, and who betakes to praying?</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Who steels the nerves, and plunges in the knife?</div>
<div class="p">But then who takes the credit?â€”Not the wife!</div>
<div class="p">Not Madame Defarge, noble woman, or</div>
<div class="p">Lady Macbeth, whose fame went to a boor.</div>
<div class="p">For while wives act, their husbands write the book,</div>
<div class="p">And in those pages Madam is a cook.</div>
<div class="p">That Lot's wife turned is an old husband's tale;</div>
<div class="p">Who wrote that Io was a cow? A male.</div>
<div class="p">That Rachel wept was weakness of the pen,</div>
<div class="p">And who said Dido shed a tear? Men!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In truth, were men to disappear from earth,</div>
<div class="p">No woman could discover it a dearth.</div>
<div class="p">The only way for peace on earth to be</div>
<div class="p">Is all to yield to femininity.</div>
<div class="p">Where there are men are wars, starvation, crime</div>
<div class="p">And every evil of a stricken clime.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I see the wisdom in that,' said the boy,</div>
<div class="p">'Yet somehow such a world I couldn't enjoy.</div>
<div class="p">'Tis of the essence, I at once admit,</div>
<div class="p">But would that world have room for me in it?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Cheer up, my man, and suffer for the cause,</div>
<div class="p">This is a country, not of men, but laws.</div>
<div class="p">Until the world is free of men, no peace</div>
<div class="p">Blooms long under the shade of man's caprice.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy, disposed to plumb another topic</div>
<div class="p">(He was an ally, but a bit myopic),</div>
<div class="p">Said, 'Surely such a half-embracing measure,</div>
<div class="p">Has time enough to wait another's leisure.</div>
<div class="p">But for the present, what befalls the mob?</div>
<div class="p">They're eating soy, inspissate in a gob;</div>
<div class="p">They've parted with their guns; heard sermons spoken;</div>
<div class="p">Now has our rabble finally awoken?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'One thing remains, before their eyes will ope.</div>
<div class="p">We must eclipse the power of the Pope!</div>
<div class="p">So long as Bibles, clergymen, and pews</div>
<div class="p">(What is a pew? Who knows! Must be a ruse.)</div>
<div class="p">Exert their sway, the mind of man will sleep,</div>
<div class="p">Then in his nightmares, run off cliffs, like sheep.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We've ta'en their bullets, Bibles, and their beef;</div>
<div class="p">Now with their butchers, barrels, and belief</div>
<div class="p">Appropriated, will the mob be quiet,</div>
<div class="p">Or will it keep up this infernal riot?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Mostly likely, now, the mob is pacified,</div>
<div class="p">Dispersed, informed, each member satisfied.</div>
<div class="p">But in th' event that even one complains,</div>
<div class="p">Send them to college and erase their brains!'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Do I predict? Do I begin to see,</div>
<div class="p">What floats in on the tide of History?</div>
<div class="p">Since evil is a refuge of the past,</div>
<div class="p">Futurity must in a mold be cast</div>
<div class="p">Of new invention, lest corrupting taint</div>
<div class="p">Prove for the Future onerous restraint.</div>
<div class="p">Abolish History, therefore, let the culture</div>
<div class="p">Come tumbling, deposed by <em>la culture</em>.</div>
<div class="p">Let libraries be rifled, bricks torn down;</div>
<div class="p">Let ministers suppress the anti-noun;</div>
<div class="p">Let nations fall, and let the globe unite,</div>
<div class="p">For all are brothers in the cause of right.</div>
<div class="p">Destroy society, and build anew,</div>
<div class="p">Then bid the Future welcome, Past <em>adieu</em>.</div>
<div class="p">For with the Past, the root of evil, burnt,</div>
<div class="p">We'll steer the Future down the rushing current.</div>
<div class="p">My vision fails, however; what awaits,</div>
<div class="p">Once we have steered our bark through isles and straits?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The Future holds that universal bliss</div>
<div class="p">That comes when man is free of prejudice,</div>
<div class="p">When institutions are designed by us,</div>
<div class="p">And when the R---t has ceased to make a fuss.</div>
<div class="p">The Future comes! See heralds on the wing!</div>
<div class="p">The glorious triumph of their Lord they sing.</div>
<div class="p">Then part the clouds, like curtains round a bed,</div>
<div class="p">And thus reveal the universal head.</div>
<div class="p">Who is it? Men are gathered out of dust;</div>
<div class="p">One object stands before their panting lust.</div>
<div class="p">Who is it? on their knees in prayer they ask,</div>
<div class="p">As in the simulacrum's light they bask.</div>
<div class="p">They prance and revel; they demand to know:</div>
<div class="p">Who is it? Who? as tears of passion flow.</div>
<div class="p">They've seen the throne of Science cry the age,</div>
<div class="p">And they've obeyed the universal Sage:</div>
<div class="p">She holds her scepter up, all overcomes,</div>
<div class="p">Then casts her wand round, strewing sugarplums.</div>
<div class="p">But who is this, the head, the mob demand?</div>
<div class="p">Who, comes the answer, but the head of Man?'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I long to have more details of the age</div>
<div class="p">When all obtain a fair and equal wage;</div>
<div class="p">When virtue has become the rule; when vice</div>
<div class="p">Has gone the way of smallpox and of lice;</div>
<div class="p">When, as you say, the world is free of men;</div>
<div class="p">When every day's a halcyon orbit; when...'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * </div>
<div class="p">The barista re-entered from his lunch,</div>
<div class="p">And found the two'd become a little bunch.</div>
<div class="p">They chattered at the table, slowly walked</div>
<div class="p">Across the floor, and all the while talked.</div>
<div class="p">They chattered at the window, then the door</div>
<div class="p">Closed to behind them, and they were no more.</div>
