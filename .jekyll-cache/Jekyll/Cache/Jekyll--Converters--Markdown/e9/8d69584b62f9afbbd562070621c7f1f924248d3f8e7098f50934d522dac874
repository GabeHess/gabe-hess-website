I"§<div class="p">Look sharp! Ho, ho! Look lively, man, it totters:</div>
<div class="p">Too green for food, send it to take the waters.</div>
<div class="p">In hand a hand, it staggers for Bath pressed</div>
<div class="p">Beside by living ghosts in pale gowns dressed.</div>
<div class="p">Through scenes surreal, we pass with inmate sick,</div>
<div class="p">Confined by languid faces floating thick</div>
<div class="p">That, leering, bob and on a torrent roll.</div>
<div class="p">"Excuse me, sir," we beg a dying soul.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It takes the waters, and in living swoon</div>
<div class="p">Falls prostrate, struck by a hostile huge moon,</div>
<div class="p">Or queasy with a pestilence: O drat!</div>
<div class="p">I grumble, and bestow a gentle pat,</div>
<div class="p">Then lead it thence; it shuffles, dozy, tame,</div>
<div class="p">With yielding temper though a stubborn name.</div>
<div class="p">Our journey over through the mazy throng,</div>
<div class="p">You thoughtfully do chaw a scuppernong,</div>
<div class="p">As nonchalantly we on it do lean
<div class="p">And ululate to Heaven with brimful spleen.
<div class="p">Our four hands work, they wring, they mirror the fret</div>
<div class="p">That labors to contort our minds, beset</div>
<div class="p">Our nerves with thousand pinching, panging pains,</div>
<div class="p">And steer a poky barge through our small veins.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Racked forth, a sob escapes my throat; you start,
<div class="p">Head cocked in chickadees' coquettish art,
<div class="p">With grave respect, impatient for the sound
<div class="p">That once did from my swollen breast resound.
<div class="p">I cry, "My spirit, covey-like, away,
<div class="p">Or pell-mell shadows fleeing 'fore the day,
<div class="p">Flies from its house; as empty stalks do fall,
<div class="p">So fall my legs, the fruit, the flower, all.
<div class="p">Infirm I suck the rays of sun for strength,
<div class="p">But nothing stymying, still fall full length.
<div class="p">I toss my head, but everywhere the bit
<div class="p">Of circumstance compels me to submit.
<div class="p">Our charge must stand, but every time it falls</div>
<div class="p">The prospect of its independence palls.</div>
<div class="p">What succors, friend, when every hope affords</div>
<div class="p">Th' accursed relapse and other like rewards?"</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But but a tender look has time to pass</div>
<div class="p">My friend's imprimatur of faceâ€”alas!</div>
<div class="p">Its knees like switchblades fold, its limbs compress</div>
<div class="p">In the all-begging posture of distress.</div>
<div class="p">Expedients exhausted, at the crux,</div>
<div class="p">When worlds dissolve, and matter is in flux,</div>
<div class="p">All heads are lost, what else remains? Quick, grab it!</div>
<div class="p">And prop it up, which will not stay by habit.</div>
<div class="p">Then scurry, friend, the other side is leaning,</div>
<div class="p">Like Pisa down in Tuscany careening.</div>
<div class="p">Now steady, girl, there steady, that's the wayâ€”</div>
<div class="p">We dredge our brows and sorely hope she'll stay.</div>
<div class="p">She swoons! O boy, a deadweight charge to catch.</div>
<div class="p">"Stand! Won't she stand! Why won't she!" we kvetch.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We always have to prop her up," I say.</div>
<div class="p">"She has a swooning fit most every day."</div>
<div class="p">On Monday she, though pale, seems yet robust,</div>
<div class="p">But Tuesday brings such nervous fits, a gust</div>
<div class="p">Of choler sweeps in Wednesday, then the next,</div>
<div class="p">She groans in ashes, absolutely vexed.</div>
<div class="p">But Friday's terror who would fain describe?</div>
<div class="p">Thank goodness it'll Saturday subside.</div>
<div class="p">Then Sunday comes, she gives an infirm cough,</div>
<div class="p">And who would know it when a limb falls off?</div>
<div class="p">We tack it on with glue and viscid stuff,</div>
<div class="p">Then check her joints and reinforce her cuff.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her limbs, as plump, plump fig-fruits bow a tree,</div>
<div class="p">And at a touch plunge with the sound of scree,</div>
<div class="p">Collapsing at the base in purple mess,</div>
<div class="p">Annoyingly do from her trunk digress.</div>
<div class="p">They fall off, one, two, catch 'em, grab 'em, "thunk,"</div>
<div class="p">Another falls, like fruits in Eden, gunk</div>
<div class="p">Spreads butter-like our hands, we scurry round,</div>
<div class="p">Like spiders sipping fruit upon the ground,</div>
<div class="p">To grab a limb and piece together like</div>
<div class="p">A jigsaw puzzle this tremendous tyke.</div>
<div class="p">Good grief! I cry. Another limb falls off.</div>
<div class="p">To that astounding puppet-trick I doff</div>
<div class="p">My hat, and coolly place it on the ground</div>
<div class="p">To have a nervous fit on it, uncrowned.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We piece together pieces plunging close.</div>
<div class="p">With helter-skelter action to engross</div>
<div class="p">And reassemble is a worthy task,</div>
<div class="p">But who would want it? I politely ask.</div>
<div class="p">Who would approximate the bust? Who would</div>
<div class="p">Make a beer-cap mosaic of Rome? Who could?</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blessed that day when this mass of conceit</div>
<div class="p">Gets wind that it can stand on its own feet.</div>
<div class="p">It groans, and languishes, and swoons, and falls,</div>
<div class="p">And plunges, decomposes, whitens, calls,</div>
<div class="p">"Good sirs, you know, I feel a little faint:</div>
<div class="p">Then, sirs, attend, please, on my nervous complaint."</div>
<div class="p">A bestial shout rends the affrighted sky,</div>
<div class="p">As discomposed I yawp and hope to die.</div>
<div class="p">"Why won't, why won't, why won't, why won't, why won't,"</div>
<div class="p">I pettily shriek, "This big buffoon, why don't,</div>
<div class="p">Why can't, why shan't, why in the name of Heav'n</div>
<div class="p">Will not this jackstraw learn the art of living?"</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nipped off in this full-flowering soliloquy,</div>
<div class="p">"Prop it up, prop it up," your words reach me.</div>
<div class="p">And dutifully I assume the task,</div>
<div class="p">And tweak the scaffold when you did but ask,</div>
<div class="p">And oil a joint to give it fluid motion</div>
<div class="p">(And prayers attend upon that potent potion),</div>
<div class="p">And thus I hope to give facility</div>
<div class="p">To th' infirm patient, our economy.</div>
<div class="p">It's such a task to prop it up. How do</div>
<div class="p">Our proppers keep it propped? With what? Bamboo?</div>
<div class="p">Soon as they ceased each sector soon would crack;</div>
<div class="p">See the arms break away, see Giant Jack,</div>
<div class="p">The Scarecrow, flailing, fall upon his back.</div>
<div class="p">Good thing we have them!</div>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
