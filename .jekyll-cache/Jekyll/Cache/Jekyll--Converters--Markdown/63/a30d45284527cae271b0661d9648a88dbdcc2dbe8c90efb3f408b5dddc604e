I"„<div class="p">O Sky, thy hue is grand enough,</div>
<div class="p">Or was at least some ages past</div>
<div class="p">When Pipe and Man on Porch and Puff</div>
<div class="p">Were bound as fam'ly, bound to last.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The thoughtful smoke rose up and up;</div>
<div class="p">Sweetly it spoke of murmured things;</div>
<div class="p">While drifting in the drowsy dreams</div>
<div class="p">It touched fair hands and flying wings.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">As rings inhaled the lusty day,</div>
<div class="p">Drank the tinctured and dainty blue,</div>
<div class="p">The lovely lilac, deep and gay,</div>
<div class="p">They feared no faceless Persian coup.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">But now the earth awakened is</div>
<div class="p">And men immune to Welkin's wand</div>
<div class="p">Find bleary-eyed enlightenment</div>
<div class="p">Of broken wonders always fond.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">And so the blue must fade and pass</div>
<div class="p">As Hera's jealous weeds mark strength</div>
<div class="p">And seek to strangle himâ€”alas,</div>
<div class="p">For now they've seen his vigor's length.</div>
