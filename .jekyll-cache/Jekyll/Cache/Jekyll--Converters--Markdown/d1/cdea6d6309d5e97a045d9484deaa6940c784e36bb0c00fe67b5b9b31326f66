<div class="p">The slith’ring serpent whispered in the ear</div>
<div class="p">Of dreaming innocence, his mission clear:</div>
<div class="p">To place his urgings garbed in common sense,</div>
<div class="p">In reason’s bloody robe to recompense</div>
<div class="p">Perceivèd wrong of He who banished wrong,</div>
<div class="p">His glory sung by bifurcated throng,</div>
<div class="p">The seething mass of Janus, of the twins.</div>
<div class="p">He mothered in his mind the fertile skins</div>
<div class="p">Of varied plots to coalesce and form</div>
<div class="p">The sullen figure of the dark’ning storm</div>
<div class="p">Erupted out, as from Jove’s pagan skull</div>
<div class="p">Leapt forth the gray-eyed armored goddess whole.</div>
<div class="p">As mothers peer into the tender crib,</div>
<div class="p">As mothers ’neath the chin adjust the bib,</div>
<div class="p">So Satan knelt beside Eve’s virgin head</div>
<div class="p">And stroked as he secured his titled dread.</div>
<div class="p">He peered and saw and drew the noose of pride;</div>
<div class="p">The thing he knew he did and so he lied.</div>
<div class="p">Her throat, unknown to her, unknown to man,</div>
<div class="p">Was forfeit in the deed of heaven’s ban;</div>
<div class="p">And as she lost her pure unsullied life,</div>
<div class="p">As Adam gained a marked and sullied wife,</div>
<div class="p">She let out from her soul’s unsounded deep</div>
<div class="p">A rush of air, then from her final sleep</div>
<div class="p">In innocence conducted she awoke,</div>
<div class="p">That moment casting down the blist’ring yoke</div>
<div class="p">Of high command unchallenged, ever feared,</div>
<div class="p">In caution from her perfect bower peered.</div>
<div class="p">To shade she kept and made her crafty way</div>
<div class="p">And dared to keep her doubting thoughts at bay;</div>
<div class="p">She slithered as the serpent to the tree,</div>
<div class="p">Henceforth to be naught but forever free.</div>
<div class="p">She tasted of the fruit and took the fall:</div>
<div class="p">Then came the second sinner broad and tall</div>
<div class="p">To eat the flesh of tempting fruit as well</div>
<div class="p">And thus to mortals open doors of Hell.</div>
