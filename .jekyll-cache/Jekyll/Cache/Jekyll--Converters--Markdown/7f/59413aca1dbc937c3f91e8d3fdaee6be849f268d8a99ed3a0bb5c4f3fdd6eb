I"…<div class="p">Thou art, it is said, a being divine</div>
<div class="p">With sunbeams for hair, yet no freckled blaze,</div>
<div class="p">A Scyllian form untold by the Nine</div>
<div class="p">And a smile prized as pÃ©tillant wine.</div>
<div class="p">â€˜To hold and well to keep,â€™ echo the maize,</div>
<div class="p">â€˜Though truth admits the first the greater name,</div>
<div class="p">To brave the perils of Medusa's gaze,</div>
<div class="p">Thus court the stone less feared than thine eyes' same;</div>
<div class="p">To keep, alack, to keep at least thy love</div>
<div class="p">Or if not that at least thy love's sweet fame</div>
<div class="p">Or still again to grasp thy phantom hand</div>
<div class="p">And slip upon its stem the cherished band.â€™</div>
<div class="p">â€˜But wert thou ever steadied like the dove,â€™</div>
<div class="p">Quip the bold and the brave, the burgeoned brass,</div>
<div class="p">â€˜Methinks my love might quaver as the spring</div>
<div class="p">When aloft on Cupid's chariot wing</div>
<div class="p">Flew reddened fruit, the wand'ring Verdure's lass.</div>
<div class="p">But as the sun prolongs Apollo's course</div>
<div class="p">And as the moon plucks his antique rays</div>
<div class="p">And as the stars the varied seasons pass,</div>
<div class="p">So yet thy glance retains its potent force</div>
<div class="p">And still my words are found as such: the worse.</div>
<div class="p">I love, but do I love? I loveâ€”adieu,</div>
<div class="p">For loving thee I lie not â€™mong the few.â€™</div>
<div class="p">As blind and seeing words exalt thy feet</div>
<div class="p">Or offend with their vain pretentious sighs</div>
<div class="p">The model of the branch heart's racers seek,</div>
<div class="p">So yet observe the heedful, humble, wise,</div>
<div class="p">The mortals best ordained to sound the scar,</div>
<div class="p">To honor purchase, and with fulcrum's bar</div>
<div class="p">To plant the spear with tasseled apex strong</div>
<div class="p">Of living manners to their part'ners bound,</div>
<div class="p">With haloed stroke perceive each every wrong,</div>
<div class="p">Not with wordsâ€”with Jove-struck Eastern round:</div>
<div class="p">This mortal sits, and sips a humble laugh</div>
<div class="p">As quivering arrows caper and dance;</div>
<div class="p">And stirring sets illusion's epitaph</div>
<div class="p">As a girl appears, mired in romance.</div>
<div class="p">There in a pool of uncommon beauty</div>
<div class="p">Floats an odd array of fragile features,</div>
<div class="p">A form well-fitted to heaven's creature</div>
<div class="p">Who, comely yet, yet calls the cox and comb</div>
<div class="p">And sets each rival's eye on duty's home,</div>
<div class="p">When truth be told her form is not so fine</div>
<div class="p">To rally armies round the Turkish Star;</div>
<div class="p">For though she is a lovely, charming sort</div>
<div class="p">No stretch of oft-stretched truth can stretch so far</div>
<div class="p">As to persuade she's not of flesh and blood.</div>
<div class="p">I pray it be no other changÃ¨d way</div>
<div class="p">For she and I, both children of the clay.</div>
