I"a<div class="p">Don't like it? Stuff it! Wear the cloth or die.</div>
<div class="p">It's critical thinking, never to ask why.</div>
<div class="p">This porous mask has holes so many that</div>
<div class="p">Your logic next to it is smooth and flat.</div>
<div class="p">Should good intentions fail to keep afloat,</div>
<div class="p">Perhaps you'll learn to navigate the moat</div>
<div class="p">Of rules proliferating which combine</div>
<div class="p">To, by my reading them, exhaust my time.</div>
<div class="p">Upon a scrap of cloth, defy the sea</div>
<div class="p">Of dumb exceptions and hypocrisy;</div>
<div class="p">Cling to that raft! or otherwise you'll drown,</div>
<div class="p">And learn the paranoia was your own.</div>
<div class="p">Fear not, your motive reasons are not muddy:</div>
<div class="p">You like to make a fool of everybody.</div>
<div class="p">To move t' irrational action is your task</div>
<div class="p">We who, now wearing, now wear not the mask.</div>
<div class="p">At any rate, we step about like sheep:</div>
<div class="p">You force us, ev'n those who 're not asleep.</div>
