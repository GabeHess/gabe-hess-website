I"ª<div class="p">Though rainbows stream above their church,</div>
<div class="p">The Hebrews even, even the Dutch,</div>
<div class="p">Through one man's moral merit or</div>
<div class="p">An expert engineering corps,</div>
<div class="p">Possessed the Covenant and the dove,</div>
<div class="p">And no deluge fear from above.</div>
<div class="p">Though hymns increase her√©tic lungs,</div>
<div class="p">And praise takes off a ramp of tongues,</div>
<div class="p">A pagan priest and warrior flock</div>
<div class="p">Could praise as easily a rock.</div>
<div class="p">Though doctrines are as simply dressed</div>
<div class="p">As Presbyterians in their best,</div>
<div class="p">One wonders whether natural man</div>
<div class="p">Could not invent a better plan.</div>
<div class="p">A stellar pagan groves often trod</div>
<div class="p">As reverently as men of God,</div>
<div class="p">And had a holy mien and vowed</div>
<div class="p">And was less holy though more proud.</div>
<div class="p">The church of heresy defies</div>
<div class="p">The scourge of error, bane of lies,</div>
<div class="p">Wand over sin, a love and force</div>
<div class="p">That collars man from his evil course.</div>
