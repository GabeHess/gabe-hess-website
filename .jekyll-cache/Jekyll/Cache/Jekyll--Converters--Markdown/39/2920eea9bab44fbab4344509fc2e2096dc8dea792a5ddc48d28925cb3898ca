I"Q<div class="p">The thud of rubber on the earth,</div>
<div class="p">Hard-packed by generations of play,</div>
<div class="p">The crack and swish, the board and net,</div>
<div class="p">The stern sweat, brothers weeping mirth,</div>
<div class="p">All striving for the outcome of the bet</div>
<div class="p">And wat'ring the thirsty broad-rimmed firth,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Speak and cry another kind of tear;</div>
<div class="p">Feed their sorrow with mem'ries of the past,</div>
<div class="p">Happier times kindled anew:</div>
<div class="p">Times those too held by all as dear,</div>
<div class="p">Then as phantoms from our children flew—</div>
<div class="p">But, Oh!, those days still box my ear!</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">An old cantankerous man am I:</div>
<div class="p">But for another game I long before I die.</div>
