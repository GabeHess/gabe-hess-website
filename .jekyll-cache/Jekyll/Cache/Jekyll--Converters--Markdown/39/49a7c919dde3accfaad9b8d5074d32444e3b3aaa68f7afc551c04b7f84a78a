I"÷<div class="p">What, having counted on a writer's hand</div>
<div class="p">To succor dreadful consciousness and peace</div>
<div class="p">Upon a soul despairing in a cage</div>
<div class="p">Of mortal flesh bring with assurance of</div>
<div class="p">A place beside the Pleiades in heav'n,</div>
<div class="p">Where men of generations yet unborn</div>
<div class="p">Will gaze and point, upon their tongues a name</div>
<div class="p">Immortal in the wheeling stars above;</div>
<div class="p">And of an excellence that brings delight:</div>
<div class="p">A fluency of motionâ€”like a dance</div>
<div class="p">Of fairies, or the winging of a birdâ€”</div>
<div class="p">What then (with glory and the coming hope</div>
<div class="p">Of glory on the issue of his pen</div>

<div class="p">Do? Dreams collapse, all melting in the light</div>
<div class="p">Of day. The stones and timbers in a house</div>
<div class="p">Of fanciful construction fall like sticks</div>
<div class="p">And sound a hopeless choir stridently.</div>
<div class="p">His hand, he knows, is not a writer's hand.</div>
<div class="p">What then, when even to compose a prose</div>
<div class="p">Or poesy quip he wants the common skill?</div>
<div class="p">Where should he find mysterious genius to</div>
<div class="p">Verse, volumes, plays and fictions, or a thrust</div>
<div class="p">Of satire set in ink? Why bloom a weed?</div>
<div class="p">But what, worse? Meager stores are all he has</div>
<div class="p">Of strong emotionâ€”sweet or bitter senseâ€”</div>
<div class="p">To feel the tragic pangs of mortal life,</div>
<div class="p">The irony and fate that wring him dry.</div>
<div class="p">He knows but rubbing raw that strips the flesh</div>
<div class="p">And grinds upon the bone till coldest chill,</div>
<div class="p">Acutest pain give way to dullest ache</div>
<div class="p">And consciousness of buried grief that moves</div>
<div class="p">No mountain stone, nor flower sprouts, nor runs</div>
<div class="p">In tearful riverbeds: is only there.</div>
