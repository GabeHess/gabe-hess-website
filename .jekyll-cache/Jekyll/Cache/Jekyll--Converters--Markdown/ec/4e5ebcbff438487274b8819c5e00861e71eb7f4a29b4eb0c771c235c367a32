I"à<div class="p">Whole thoughts in poetry have no place,</div>
<div class="p">Nor prose expressions at slow pace</div>
<div class="p">Possessing all the mind, and roosting heavy</div>
<div class="p">Upon it as a poll tax or quail bevy.</div>
<div class="p">Profound equivocal long lines that dash</div>
<div class="p">Or lumber through a stanza and rehash</div>
<div class="p">Divine light that once vexed a daily stroll</div>
<div class="p">And struck a poet to his poet's soul;</div>
<div class="p">Or moments of a personal poet's grief,</div>
<div class="p">Joy, father's love, or stale divine motif;</div>
<div class="p">A host of heavy sitting thoughtsâ€”begone!â€”</div>
<div class="p">And have the wondrous artistry of song.</div>
