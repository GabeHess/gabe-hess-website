I"<div class="p">The spray of berries bursting at the touch</div>
<div class="p">Of pickers come to claim their lawful tithe</div>
<div class="p">Yields forth its fruit in baskets overmuch</div>
<div class="p">Weighed down by victims of the nimble scythe.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The hands of children carry off the prize;</div>
<div class="p">Their looks demand no tribute from my quill,</div>
<div class="p">For sentiment—thus tradition's assize—</div>
<div class="p">As this adorns a too affected rill.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Great trouble is occasioned by the task</div>
<div class="p">Of keeping whole the berries as they part</div>
<div class="p">From brambly shrubs where they'd bethought to bask</div>
<div class="p">Before the children brought Norwegian art.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">A tableaued feast will lull the waiting clan</div>
<div class="p">If fruit made ripe by solar heat and time</div>
<div class="p">Survives the anxious journey happ'ly ran,</div>
<div class="p">The toters colored with the hue of Syme.</div>
