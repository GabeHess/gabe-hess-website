I"e<div class="p">A boor put pudgy fingers over wings</div>
<div class="p">Of a white moth, and smudged their powdered cloth;</div>
<div class="p">A young knight to behold made him most wroth,</div>
<div class="p">Whereon he strained with might and warmth of kings.</div>
<div class="p">He leant his body to a blow upon</div>
<div class="p">That hapless Goth, who crumpled in defeat,</div>
<div class="p">A mountain pale as with a snowy sheet</div>
<div class="p">Invested; then soft-kissed the likewise wan</div>
<div class="p">Hand of the moth transmuted to a maid,</div>
<div class="p">Who drew it from him with a strange, vexed look,</div>
<div class="p">As if she knew not of that blow he took,</div>
<div class="p">Nor trusted who had her bold hector flayed.</div>
<div class="p">Straight the police cuffed his offending hand,</div>
<div class="p">He strove in vain to witness honor's plight,</div>
<div class="p">But they averred his share was cold, dead, trite;</div>
<div class="p">And knights of yore no longer scourge the land.</div>
<div class="p">They three withdrew to frowns and disapproval:</div>
<div class="p">He went, but made appeal to the maid's eye,</div>
<div class="p">But even she turned from himâ€”worse her swivel</div>
<div class="p">To bear than when knights in good graces die!</div>
<div class="p">The risks of chivalry are more than books imply!</div>
