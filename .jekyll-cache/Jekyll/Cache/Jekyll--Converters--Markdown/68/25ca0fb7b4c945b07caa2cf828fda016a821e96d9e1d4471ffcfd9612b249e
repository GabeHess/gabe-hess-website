I"Ä<div class="p">Well, Joe from Scranton, by some native charm,</div>
<div class="p">Tricked his way into the Columbian seat,</div>
<div class="p">Where warmly gimbaled by his pet schoolmarm,</div>
<div class="p">He executes the rigors of defeat.</div>
<div class="p">His skyey forehead and his billowing mask</div>
<div class="p">Adorn the desk of destiny where men</div>
<div class="p">Bring plattered paper, and politely ask</div>
<div class="p">His signature. With one stroke of his pen</div>
<div class="p">A thousand jobs quit these twin-skirted shores,</div>
<div class="p">Ulysses plunges in Phaeacia's sport,</div>
<div class="p">America engages with kind wars,</div>
<div class="p">Andâ€”C'mon manâ€”more nuisances abort</div>
<div class="p">The Doctors (make salaam) of our great state.</div>
<div class="p">The chore is perfectâ€”penman is resigned</div>
<div class="p">Whate'er they bring him to subscribe it straight,</div>
<div class="p">No paper (what a man!) to leave unsigned.</div>
<div class="p">He executes dark winter and dark night.</div>
<div class="p">His stick is Unity, press secretary</div>
<div class="p">Is Science, for the rest, all are polite,</div>
<div class="p">Experienced, and well-credentialed very.</div>
<div class="p">The state had coveted a milquetoast head,</div>
<div class="p">They hasted to steal fleeting peace and quiet,</div>
<div class="p">They raised a sissy in a "bully's" stead,</div>
<div class="p">Who was assertive when skinheads would riot:</div>
<div class="p">Gentle man! he even raised his treble voice,</div>
<div class="p">He planted his foot by the shores of hope,</div>
<div class="p">He vowed t' imprison all the rowdy boys</div>
<div class="p">Who almost swung his Senate from a rope.</div>
<div class="p">The ting of crisis is his daily bread.</div>
<div class="p">All luck attend upon his Little Joe!</div>
<div class="p">We hope he keeps a span his ancient head,</div>
<div class="p">Then loses it on one unlucky throw.</div>
<div class="p">Oh Joe! Your great ambition is a trunk</div>
<div class="p">Without a headâ€”embrace it!â€”but, Joe, what</div>
<div class="p">Manana end is truth of soapbox bunk?</div>
<div class="p">Was it for greed, my ancient friend? Oh tut!</div>
