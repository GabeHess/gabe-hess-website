<div class="p">And spoke with people whom he metâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Be they handsome lords or peasants wanting youthâ€”</div>
<div class="p">And his words have not been forgotten yet.</div>
<div class="p">He talked of virtue, and the gods,</div>
<div class="p">He gathered friends and enemies,</div>
<div class="p">He pondered not how to garner nods</div>
<div class="p">And he scorned the mimics' exacted fees.</div>
<div class="p">He touched no pen and hoarded no fame,</div>
<div class="p">He wondered with a child's eyes,</div>
<div class="p">Yet silence still falls at the sound of his name</div>
<div class="p">And the year has not come wherein his glory dies.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was wed to the grave for seeking worthy things</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he should have been falling on Icarian wings.</div>
