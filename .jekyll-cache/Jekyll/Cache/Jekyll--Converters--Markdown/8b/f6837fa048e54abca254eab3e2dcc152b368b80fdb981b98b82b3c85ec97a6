I"<div class="p">The infinity of substance between light and dark</div>
<div class="p">Blurs the play of shadows on the forest floor;</div>
<div class="p">The light occulted by the leaves were stark,</div>
<div class="p">But that the gulf between the earth and sky</div>
<div class="p">A riot of illusion makes,</div>
<div class="p">To throw the shadows, borne of regions high,</div>
<div class="p">Into confusion, changeful tempers of light and dark,</div>
<div class="p">Which passing moderns many times remark.</div>
