I"<div class="p">I struck from page a spark with pen,</div>
<div class="p">Intending to delineate</div>
<div class="p">A roseate damsel alien</div>
<div class="p">To all these times of late.</div>
<div class="p">But she, I found, was too much gone</div>
<div class="p">From subtle systems reared aloft;</div>
<div class="p">Fallen is virtue's tinted dawn,</div>
<div class="p">The lovely garden seared and soft.</div>
<div class="p">The harsh noon's light has blasted flowers</div>
<div class="p">Accustomed to less sultry showers.</div>
