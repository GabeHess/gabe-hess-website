I"˜<div class="p">Sing in praise of mercy and of justice and of love;</div>
<div class="p">Glory in the Hyacinthine stars that shine above</div>
<div class="p">Risen as a flowered field from mother Gaia's blood;</div>
<div class="p">Ponder how the heated swamp begat man's nat'ral bud;</div>
<div class="p">Having freed thy ticking mind from bias and from wall,</div>
<div class="p">Prejudicial thoughts of dogma andâ€”<em>mon Dieu!</em>â€”the Fall</div>
<div class="p">Trapping men in fetters, irksome ropes, immortal chains</div>
<div class="p">Never turn thy mind to universal birthing pains;</div>
<div class="p">Twist thy hand to pat thy back and sing thy praise aloud;</div>
<div class="p">Scorn thy fellow bondsmen with less reasoning endowedâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Thy tactics and maneuvers are quick and clean and deft;</div>
<div class="p">But when thou've conquered all, ask the Universeâ€”'What's left?'</div>
