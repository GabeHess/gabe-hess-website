I"&<div class="p">The furrowed earth awaits the seed—</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The field has known the plow—</div>
<div class="p">And dreaming where a crop had lain,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another harvest now.</div>
<div class="p">The horses rest, the farmers sleep,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gazers gaze no more;</div>
<div class="p">And though no rebel sign appears</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They marshal Spring's encore.</div>
<div class="p">Line's swift lovers begrudge their turn;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And demons to defend</div>
<div class="p">From dragon's teeth will soon arise</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with the birds contend.</div>
<div class="p">Aeolus in peace will slumber:</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We pray it will be so;</div>
<div class="p">Sweet though we fix his ev'ry dream</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind, he still must blow.</div>
<div class="p">Pluvious must be kept in calm</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still alive and well,</div>
<div class="p">For when our fathers saw his back</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Disease their race befell.</div>
<div class="p">Nature, grace our mortal trenches</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else the Tower fall,</div>
<div class="p">For even now while all things sleep</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We fear thy vengeful pall.</div>
