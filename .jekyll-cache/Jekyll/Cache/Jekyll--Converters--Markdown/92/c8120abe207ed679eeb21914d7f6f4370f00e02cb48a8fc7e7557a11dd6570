I"ý<div class="p">The worn path of all mere sub-lunar things</div>
<div class="p">Has had reception of a thousand feet,</div>
<div class="p">Been all re-walked by free-lance poets' feet,</div>
<div class="p">Who chase the sordid scoop the worn path brings.</div>
<div class="p">When by sustained assault might borrow wings</div>
<div class="p">A small-town poet and traverse the skies</div>
<div class="p">With flights along a path made otherwise,</div>
<div class="p">Along the Milky Way or Blossom Springs</div>
<div class="p">That strew the path to the celestial 'bode</div>
<div class="p">Of all mysterious finery of verse</div>
<div class="p">And pith of poetry, bequeathed of Godâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Twain image and rich marrow of cut words?</div>
<div class="p">Trudge here below, though, for the flight aboveâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Nay, fly above on wondrous wings of Love!</div>
<div class="p">Nay, nay do whatso might your pen behoove.</div>
<div class="p">Try how you might the Muse-lorn age improve.
