I"À<div class="p">Immortal day! the scrub-faced freshman sings</div>
<div class="p">With treble rapture for ethereal things;</div>
<div class="p">His beaming face confesses all afire</div>
<div class="p">A mind that whiffs and traces prior and prior.</div>
<div class="p">The healthy, wholesome innocence of youth</div>
<div class="p">Strains after the eternal flame of truth,</div>
<div class="p">Fair proof the dotage of the cultured world</div>
<div class="p">Has tender leaflets yet by Spring unfurled.</div>
<div class="p">With quivering passion, sedulous for lore,</div>
<div class="p">Affections groping for themes more and more,</div>
<div class="p">With nimble fingers grasping office tools,
<div class="p">Pride's passport through the binder-happy schools,
<div class="p">Our wide-eyed Freshman ogles trembling spheres</div>
<div class="p">Of things unknown with mingled hopes and fears.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tucked under his spaghetti arms, behold</div>
<div class="p">The notebooks, note-full, leaf on leaf of gold.</div>
<div class="p">No gentle hint warns him from scribbling notes</div>
<div class="p">Of heady notions and pertaining quotes,</div>
<div class="p">Which pile and pile before he has a class,</div>
<div class="p">And skyward soar a thousand miles, alas.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Dawn's rose-fingers signal Freshman's day,</div>
<div class="p">With weary but with grateful Freshman fay,</div>
<div class="p">From Homer's study through the summer long,</div>
<div class="p">He grits his teeth and vows not to be wrong.</div>
<div class="p">The dormitory's gates of learning ope,</div>
<div class="p">He enters with an intellect and soap.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commence the universal day of Whirl,</div>
<div class="p">Alike enjoyed by costumed boy and girl.</div>
<div class="p">The instant intimates across the hall,</div>
<div class="p">Where girls wait for their friends to take the fall;</div>
<div class="p">The manly and professional tones where-</div>
<div class="p">With students introduce their namesâ€”"John," "Dante"â€”pair</div>
<div class="p">Of almost horribly impersonal</div>
<div class="p">Aloof acquaintance geographical</div>
<div class="p">And all the restâ€”ah, dwindle-shouldered men</div>
<div class="p">With baby faces talk as good as ten!</div>
<div class="p">The snubbing upperclassmen, swarm-bound, pass</div>
<div class="p">From rooms when Freshmen enter for a class,</div>
<div class="p">And mutter as they go, "Freshmen," with wit</div>
<div class="p">Three years bestows, they laugh and go, the hit
<div class="p">O'erawed gapes where the lampoon tasted flesh,
<div class="p">His soul yearns for a terrible egress.
<div class="p">Impassioned bureaucrats discourse while meeting,
<div class="p">Their droning, never-ending themes repeating:
<div class="p">The calendar: "Resilience in College"â€”
<div class="p">One needs resilience to bear this knowledge!
<div class="p">And thousand scheduled suchlike hours glad hearts
<div class="p">That feared to find exacting liberal arts.
<div class="p">Vainglorious administrators proud</div>
<div class="p">Of their one office that bears wind and cloud,</div>
<div class="p">Bestride, than wind or tide a greater force
<div class="p">Of nature, with a driving, roaring course
<div class="p">That over-sweeping mauls its jaw-bound catch,
<div class="p">A bureaucratic wave of highest pitch.
<div class="p">The slouching Freshmen with their heads of hair</div>
<div class="p">Who mutter awkwardly on every stair;</div>
<div class="p">The greasy long-haired intellectual chaps</div>
<div class="p">Who pit for Freshmen intellectual traps,</div>
<div class="p">Discourse on justice, geometry convex;</div>
<div class="p">The cliquish girls who segregate by sex,</div>
<div class="p">And look superior being, theirs, across</div>
<div class="p">The room where dwell gorillas dressed and boss;</div>
<div class="p">The more inclusive boys who clap the back</div>
<div class="p">Of any willing party to their pack;</div>
<div class="p">That one most hated student, mouth of foam,</div>
<div class="p">High-pitched, aggressive, hammering points home,</div>
<div class="p">With wild exaggeration of expression,</div>
<div class="p">And always some irrelevant obsession;</div>
<div class="p">The smooth-toned know-alls with stock thinker phrases;</div>
<div class="p">The hooded music lovers in malaises;</div>
<div class="p">The "hey man" men; those liberated West-</div>
<div class="p">Adopted Indian, Asian girls oppressed:</div>
<div class="p">The male chumps mass, contribute small remarks,
<div class="p">Discover purpose when their lady barks,
<div class="p">And fall in line to kick their father's corpse.
<div class="p">With drawling tones, these miniature Thorpes
<div class="p">Confess to crimes committed April last,
<div class="p">And flagellate the body of their past.
<div class="p">The jester with a leer and funny voice,</div>
<div class="p">That makes one think ill, like the girls, of boys;</div>
<div class="p">The varied characters with common views</div>
<div class="p">Of philosophical thingsâ€”and the news.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The day approaches when the two wires touch:</div>
<div class="p">One boasts of little study, one of much;</div>
<div class="p">One Homer read by summer, and forgot;</div>
<div class="p">And one had read, will read sometime, or not.</div>
<div class="p">Class starts! all grinâ€”say hard, but getting onâ€”</div>
<div class="p">And heighten or dismiss to peer or don.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Whirl, the Whirlâ€”where did those sweet years go?</div>
<div class="p">Nobody knows where time's smooth currents flow.</div>
<div class="p">But good times, bad times; frenzied study, lax;</div>
<div class="p">Sweep Freshmen toward their odyssey's climax.</div>
<div class="p">A well-adjusted young adult begowned</div>
<div class="p">Appears with learning's foursquare headgear crowned;</div>
<div class="p">He takes life's dancing reigns with debt and knowledge,</div>
<div class="p">And blusters his descendants off to college.</div>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
