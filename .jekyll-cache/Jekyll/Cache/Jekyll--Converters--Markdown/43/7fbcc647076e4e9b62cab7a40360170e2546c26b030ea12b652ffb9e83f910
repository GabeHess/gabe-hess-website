I"ì<div class="p">The softened colors of his dream-world fade;</div>
<div class="p">His dreams of Philly and Miami-Dade</div>
<div class="p">Disperse and dreams of yet another sort</div>
<div class="p">His fanciful romantic life support.</div>
<div class="p">Conscious, he shakes his head, with rippling mane,</div>
<div class="p">For Mr. Muscle is a fop and vain,</div>
<div class="p">His jaw clear-chiseled, and a god's physique.</div>
<div class="p">A morning mist bedews each lovely cheek</div>
<div class="p">Of a sweet goddess, starting from repose</div>
<div class="p">As starts a kitten when a zephyr blows.</div>
<div class="p">And grace plays softly o'er her lustrous face,</div>
<div class="p">For she's a manufactory of grace.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They prosecute the business of the day,</div>
<div class="p">Rent hard apart by solace and dismay;</div>
<div class="p">The lines of worry blazoned in their face,</div>
<div class="p">But softening with the latest on the race;</div>
<div class="p">Until the clock shows half eleven past,</div>
<div class="p">And sunshine breaks into their world at last.</div>
<div class="p">Two strangers dash into the street, embrace,</div>
<div class="p">And share congratulations on the race.</div>
<div class="p">But vast event our vision whirls away</div>
<div class="p">To sights of frantic millions in array</div>
<div class="p">Who flood the streets, do a generic dance,</div>
<div class="p">And look like long-legged spiders in a trance.</div>
<div class="p">See love and tolerance the severed head</div>
<div class="p">Raise on a pike with ghastly stains of red.</div>
<div class="p">Benevolence itself burns effigies,</div>
<div class="p">And justice celebrates with the Chinese.</div>
<div class="p">See harassed liberal professors saunter;</div>
<div class="p">And Steven Pinker dance beside a flaunter;</div>
<div class="p">He trusts but one authority, his REASON,</div>
<div class="p">Except the media in election season.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See prodigies go flaming through the air;</div>
<div class="p">Two stars align, a most unusual pair,</div>
<div class="p">A star that died a thousand years ago,</div>
<div class="p">And a bright star new-born and all aglow.</div>
<div class="p">And mathematical moon-children writhe,</div>
<div class="p">And wake into the night, a morning tithe</div>
<div class="p">For standing timber, ancient as the church,</div>
<div class="p">Established as a much graffitied birch.</div>
<div class="p">Perplexing numbers mount, and sway between</div>
<div class="p">The counties as the grasses of a green:</div>
<div class="p">Numbers grotesque! which leer with bulbous faces,</div>
<div class="p">And are as plastic as Corona cases.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sick, rise, walk embrace upon the street;</div>
<div class="p">Two people press on the verge of six feet;</div>
<div class="p">More miracles, say sources, are assured:</div>
<div class="p">He's just elected and the plague is cured!</div>
<div class="p">Throngs shifting hazily mass and unmass;</div>
<div class="p">Oceanic billows of dark floating gas</div>
<div class="p">Could no more threading, drifting, riffling, part,</div>
<div class="p">Then rush as sucked upon their unseen heart.</div>
<div class="p">The feckless motion beggars copious air:</div>
<div class="p">There faints a councilman, here swoons a mayor.</div>
<div class="p">Hear babble mount unto a heady roar,</div>
<div class="p">Then cease in concert vast across the corps.</div>
<div class="p">The hushed crowd parts, his reverence appears,</div>
<div class="p">Alumnus wise of profitable years,</div>
<div class="p">Crowned with the laurels of benignant age,</div>
<div class="p">And known in foreign circles as a sage.</div>
<div class="p">Admiring murmurs pierce the reigning hush,</div>
<div class="p">As silence is whelmed in a sudden rush;</div>
<div class="p">These voices compliment his coordination,</div>
<div class="p">Those say he runs well, why not run the nation?</div>
<div class="p">'Tis Papa Joe! beloved Iosefâ€”kind,</div>
<div class="p">Well-mannered, generous, with a shrewd mind;</div>
<div class="p">A storyteller, shoe-string, backwoods man,</div>
<div class="p">A dad, a husband. Here's how he began:</div>
<div class="p">"Back home in Scranton"â€”then with folksy charm,</div>
<div class="p">Told an old story from his turkey farm,</div>
<div class="p">Or oil refinery, or kitchen table,</div>
<div class="p">Or segregation, from his stallion stable,</div>
<div class="p">His mother, schoolhouse, his mechanic's shop,</div>
<div class="p">His cottage, townhouse, trailer, or his pop.</div>
<div class="p">From humble roots, by aspiration great,</div>
<div class="p">See him surmount, and stand astraddle fate.</div>
<div class="p">A practiced actor, with excessive gall,</div>
<div class="p">With pathos and with sympathy withal,</div>
<div class="p">Conversable, and silver-tongued, and sweet,</div>
<div class="p">Original, mysterious, discreet,</div>
<div class="p">An orator, a Cicero, a King,</div>
<div class="p">His address mounting on the very wing</div>
<div class="p">Of eloquence, from the majestic pitch</div>
<div class="p">On which he flies, he then resorts to kitsch;</div>
<div class="p">Whence eloquence returns from banishment</div>
<div class="p">His lofty sentiments to ornament;</div>
<div class="p">Until, commended by Who Ought to Know,</div>
<div class="p">None question he's the ghost of Cicero.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He tells of an historic coalition:</div>
<div class="p">How College Brat, unbiased academician,</div>
<div class="p">And less punctilious pedagogue united,</div>
<div class="p">And proved their perquisite to be shortsighted;</div>
<div class="p">How scruples kneecapped some across the aisle,</div>
<div class="p">Some conscientious souls disliked his style,</div>
<div class="p">Some penitents prostrated by their past</div>
<div class="p">For half atonement's sake a ballot cast;</div>
<div class="p">How great enthusing forces purple states,</div>
<div class="p">Till numbers triumphed, in torrential spates,</div>
<div class="p">Past difficulties swept, with reckless joy.</div>
<div class="p">Caught in the sudden rush of hoi polloi,</div>
<div class="p">From private, dusty charnel chambers, note,</div>
<div class="p">Oh reader dear, the dead ariseâ€”and vote!</div>
<div class="p">Our modern Burke declaims against the wise</div>
<div class="p">Who would the hallowed dead disenfranchise;</div>
<div class="p">With fury flushed, with glory decked, and puffing,</div>
<div class="p">Pontificating splendidly, and bluffing.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Papa Joe begins to speak in tongues;</div>
<div class="p">And lest an awkward thing escape his lungs,</div>
<div class="p">They lead his docile person from the stage;</div>
<div class="p">He shuffles thence to foofaraws and rage,</div>
<div class="p">The throngs adore their Sage of Scranton so:</div>
<div class="p">He's such a charmer, an inveterate Joe.</div>
