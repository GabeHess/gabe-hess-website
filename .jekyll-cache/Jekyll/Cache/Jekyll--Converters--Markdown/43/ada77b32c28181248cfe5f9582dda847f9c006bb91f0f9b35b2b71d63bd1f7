I"ç<div class="p">The burning temple, high upon a rock</div>
<div class="p">Or crag or ledge upon the marble dome</div>
<div class="p">Of Heaven with angelic escort rayed</div>
<div class="p">Ambassadors to bring the cheerful news</div>
<div class="p">Of life to earth; they came upon a garden,</div>
<div class="p">Inside beholding ordered rows of flowers,</div>
<div class="p">Where, gleaming brightly, treasure-eyes were held</div>
<div class="p">Reposing in the petals; but in time</div>
<div class="p">The temple's fire waned; below on earth</div>
<div class="p">Ambassadors could barely penetrate,</div>
<div class="p">The sun at noon could scarcely bear to look,</div>
<div class="p">The garden grew with weeds so rank and strong</div>
<div class="p">That, sharp, no spade, and, strong, no hand could pull.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * </div>
<div class="p">Lady Earth, of late a blooming beauty,</div>
<div class="p">Is now a withered creature with a shawl;</div>
<div class="p">A matronly, foul-figured, yellow-teethed,</div>
<div class="p">And vulgar-speaking harlot of a dame.</div>
<div class="p">Shed are her gay and airy robes; instead</div>
<div class="p">Are ugly trappings pinned high with a brooch</div>
<div class="p">Of vulgar eminence. Dame Ugly stalks,</div>
<div class="p">Bestrewing with her wand the benisons</div>
<div class="p">Of ugliness: to toss one's head, carefree,</div>
<div class="p">For having let the winds disperse harsh care;</div>
<div class="p">To revel in the mire; and to press</div>
<div class="p">The world upon a bosom sickly kept;</div>
<div class="p">Untruth, confusion, thousand chirping sounds</div>
<div class="p">In crass cacophony, and leers so lewd</div>
<div class="p">As crash upon the wrecked strand of the world.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * </div>
<div class="p">The world is ugly; witness this tall mass</div>
<div class="p">Of buildings breaking on the lines of ruin</div>
<div class="p">That throw them into clash and nullity;</div>
<div class="p">With matter, colors; and the whole conspires</div>
<div class="p">To drive one's head into a hole, aground.</div>
<div class="p">These canvas-pigments witness, words page-bound</div>
<div class="p">Thrown topsy-turvy, harum-scarum, wild,</div>
<div class="p">And reckless-rash, with but sufficient thought</div>
<div class="p">To make it ugly rather than confused.</div>
<div class="p">And see the people studying to repulse</div>
<div class="p">With looks unnatural woven in their hair,</div>
<div class="p">Crossed on their brow, and giving animation.</div>
<div class="p">See gray complexions; dreary, forlorn things;</div>
<div class="p">Hear viscid words, and words that catch on air,</div>
<div class="p">So foul, so ugly air would hinder passage.</div>
<div class="p">Smell, taste, and feel the odor, taste, and touch</div>
<div class="p">Which reeks in putrefaction, curls the tongue,</div>
<div class="p">And makes the nerves to vibrate with discord</div>
<div class="p">And jangling dissonance. Then pat the world,</div>
<div class="p">And say, of course our doctors are real good.</div>
