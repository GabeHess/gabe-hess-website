I"ý	<div class="p">Where in the conflux of a modern life</div>
<div class="p">To find a woman fit to be a wife?</div>
<div class="p">How woo a shadow, chivalrously court</div>
<div class="p">A woman known by hearsay and report?</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Now innocence and beauty are the silt</div>
<div class="p">Of streams long dry. A thousand flowers wilt</div>
<div class="p">That struck their roots upon the banks of time.</div>
<div class="p">They thirst for water, while soil cries for lime.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The modern age has withered everything.</div>
<div class="p">A vengeful spirit clips the avian wing.</div>
<div class="p">And now the Graces are a painted Fury</div>
<div class="p">Which brings no peace to victim or to jury.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Now take the womanâ€”and forget the man,</div>
<div class="p">No better he, who follows Occam's van.</div>
<div class="p">What have we then: a gargoyle's vanity?</div>
<div class="p">Or Steinem marching with good Tammany?</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">In place of innocence, a coquette's smiles;</div>
<div class="p">Where unaffected, now affected wiles!</div>
<div class="p">Once music sweet, but see, a tawdry play</div>
<div class="p">Consumes itself before the passing day.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">In legion mirrors, the vainest, vulgarest show</div>
<div class="p">Amuses, mimics, flatters Lady Roe,</div>
<div class="p">Who might not be so easily impressed</div>
<div class="p">If Mirror Roe were not in fancy dressed.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The fashions of the day she powders on:</div>
<div class="p">The lowest average is a new <em>bon ton</em>.</div>
<div class="p">She valiantly struggles for the mean,</div>
<div class="p">The only time you'll catch her looking keen.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Now ugliness and hollow-skull combine:</div>
<div class="p">They are the triumph of a servile time.</div>
<div class="p">Of slouching gesture, quaggy voice and leer,</div>
<div class="p">She would 'fear nothing but the name of fear.'</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Rare always, but more rare with fondness fled,</div>
<div class="p">A charming rival men would choose to wed,</div>
<div class="p">She dwells in secret, exercising art</div>
<div class="p">As must undo her <em>fille de chambre's</em> heart.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The world does not her know or care</div>
<div class="p">To know her, though her sweet and fair</div>
<div class="p">Complexion is a chastisement</div>
<div class="p">To this our world of modern bent.</div>
