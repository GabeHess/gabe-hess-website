I"±<div class="p">O Chanticleer's art of sweet checkered mirth,</div>
<div class="p">Why dost thou follow and follow anguish?</div>
<div class="p">Thou findest him dull, and dismal, rebirth?</div>
<div class="p">Thou seekest laughter in men that languish?</div>
<div class="p">Thy life is placed before thy coming death?</div>
<div class="p">Just soâ€”yet death thy happy songs flower;</div>
<div class="p">And as thou might mention Spring's simple breath</div>
<div class="p">Thou yield instead to christened mood, Dour.</div>
<div class="p">Having well established thy cynic's view</div>
<div class="p">And satirized the  Sunday's joy soundly</div>
<div class="p">And at tradition hazarded a mew,</div>
<div class="p">Thou deemest thyself enlightened roundly.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A curdled, crying, hidden fool is he</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who sees the jesting rhymes, yet cannot see.</div>
