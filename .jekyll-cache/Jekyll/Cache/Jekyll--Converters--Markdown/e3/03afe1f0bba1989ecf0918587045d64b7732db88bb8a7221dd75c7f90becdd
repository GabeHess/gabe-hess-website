I"<div class="p">In ringing circles stretching miles around,</div>
<div class="p">As great seas, kneelers some of us saw knelt,</div>
<div class="p">But rising like a flagpole in their midst</div>
<div class="p">Firm-planted stood a man unmoved by guilt.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He surveyed the concentric worshipers</div>
<div class="p">With wry, ironic aspect at their fool's</div>
<div class="p">Amusement, and his folded arms partook</div>
<div class="p">Of judgment his of far-flung fawning pools.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Symbolic act works men into a state,</div>
<div class="p">But nor would he intone, nor sway, nor bend;</div>
<div class="p">He rather stood as Devil's hymnody</div>
<div class="p">The whole square's ears without surcease would rend.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He rose! Heroic heights are scorned by small</div>
<div class="p">And petty souls who tear the pedestal,</div>
<div class="p">But kneelers scarcely could do injury</div>
<div class="p">To one who stood despite their willed control.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He pursed a little his pale, pleated lips,</div>
<div class="p">Then walked away, as worshipers rose, walked</div>
<div class="p">Away conjointly with affairs to join,</div>
<div class="p">And all and he were mingled; they even talked.</div>
