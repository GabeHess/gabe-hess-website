I"Ë<div class="p">Behold! before the judgment of the nations</div>
<div class="p">A host of premises in conflagrations.</div>
<div class="p">O ancient Reason, wherefore art thou knocked</div>
<div class="p">A hammer on thy head, and, Reason, docked</div>
<div class="p">To sit in trial for a court of fools</div>
<div class="p">Who point and gesture, making up the rules?</div>
<div class="p">Voltaire inventing God was not so dull</div>
<div class="p">As to the imagine the material pull,</div>
<div class="p">That impulse or the law of staid momentum</div>
<div class="p">Could govern man when by the right <em>per centum</em></div>
<div class="p">Increased, diminished, or inclined to act</div>
<div class="p">By cold inhuman residue of fact.</div>
<div class="p">Did tortured Nietzsche think his net had caught</div>
<div class="p">A modern substitute for murdered <em>Ought</em>?</div>
<div class="p">One cannot blame the genius for his folly</div>
<div class="p">Once he had rid the world of good ol' golly.</div>
<div class="p">Our lot is with the men of science and</div>
<div class="p">In scientific terms we understand</div>
<div class="p">Dread goddess <em>Ought</em>; <em>in Ratio</em> discuss</div>
<div class="p"><em>Mysterium</em> of Nature. Come, let us</div>
<div class="p">Our heads apply collective to the muddle;</div>
<div class="p">Our heads, which from the Palaeozoic puddle</div>
<div class="p">In bygone aeons crept: a sort of slime</div>
<div class="p">Drawn by the finger-stub of the sublime</div>
<div class="p">Imparting energy in whispers to</div>
<div class="p">The clumping mud (Behold, a parvenu!).</div>
<div class="p">And let us break at last Old Harry's curse,</div>
<div class="p">For Harry's been outbid by free commerce.</div>
<div class="p">The Lord of Flies is master of confusion</div>
<div class="p">And drowns us in the science of illusion.</div>
<div class="p">The crux, however, is not recognized</div>
<div class="p">By every fool who's not the gift of eyes.</div>
<div class="p">Say some: 'If matter is a fact,'</div>
<div class="p">(Forgive these men deficiency of tact),</div>
<div class="p">'There is no doubt that value follows after'â€”</div>
<div class="p">Behold, the Roman Church erupts in laughter!</div>
<div class="p">I heard it at St. Peter's and in Rome,</div>
<div class="p">And pealing from the rafters of Cologne.</div>
<div class="p">I heard it on the Paraguayan plains,</div>
<div class="p">The rumblings of thousand aeroplanes.</div>
<div class="p">Word of it breathed from priests in Ireland,</div>
<div class="p">From humble country priests in low Poland.</div>
<div class="p">I heard it on the tops of Ecuador,</div>
<div class="p">And half the tiny island of Timor!</div>
<div class="p">And then I traveled all the way to France</div>
<div class="p">And heard it even there!â€”although askance</div>
<div class="p">Were public <em>philosophists</em> and their talk</div>
<div class="p">Did smite my ear with words of 'What a <em>choc</em>!'</div>
<div class="p">I heard it rumbling over pitted earth,</div>
<div class="p">The shaking, rolling, even sound of mirth.</div>
<div class="p">It burst all bridles and escaped the pope!</div>
<div class="p">If so, for us poor sinners there is hope.</div>
<div class="p">And everywhere I traveled I could hear</div>
<div class="p">The sound of laughter dinning in my ear.</div>
<div class="p">And then returning to my sweet Virginia,</div>
<div class="p">I heard it just as clear as in Hibernia.</div>
<div class="p">This laughter reaching even to my home</div>
<div class="p">Shook the foundations of the Church in Rome.</div>
<div class="p">Then spoke the pontiff, in miter and robe;</div>
<div class="p">A voice that thundered round and round the globe:</div>
<div class="p">'They name us "dogmatists" and bypast "dopes,"</div>
<div class="p">But look ye at the fountain of their hopes!</div>
<div class="p">O we are superstitious, true, but how</div>
<div class="p">Are they yet milking this colossal cow?'</div>
<div class="p">Be still, bold pen, no 'headstrong' and obey:</div>
<div class="p">Relate what other scoundrels have to say.</div>
<div class="p">These others: 'Let us all be sensible'â€”</div>
<div class="p">Just so! and sense is indefensible</div>
<div class="p">Without the aid of reason, which I'd thought</div>
<div class="p">We had agreed was th' Atlas of dread <em>Ought</em>.</div>
<div class="p">And others: 'We shall our own ethics craft.'</div>
<div class="p">Well spoke! but how to veto any draft?</div>
<div class="p">Still others: 'At this point stare long and hard,</div>
<div class="p">In eyes' periphery place this card,</div>
<div class="p">And when you glance up you will see</div>
<div class="p">That all the world will spinning be;</div>
<div class="p">But as the motion winds and grinds</div>
<div class="p">Down and down, a thousand lines</div>
<div class="p">Will come to be, as I have told,</div>
<div class="p">Apparently as lines of old.'</div>
<div class="p">With incantations thus the matter stands,</div>
<div class="p">A card slipped from the cuff in Reason's hands.</div>
<div class="p">'Look here, long, hard, then there glance,</div>
<div class="p">And as it was'â€”but necromance</div>
<div class="p">A hundred thousand years, if truth you seek,</div>
<div class="p">You'll only find if at the card you peek.</div>
<div class="p">And so the pageant winds itself around</div>
<div class="p">Religion's unattended burial mound,</div>
<div class="p">In tighter coils, tighter, tighter still,</div>
<div class="p">To harvest energy for Reason's mill.</div>
<div class="p">But as around it coils like a snake,</div>
<div class="p">It never will be charmed, for goodness' sake,</div>
<div class="p">But spiral into gross absurdity,</div>
<div class="p">And call it 'scientific liberty.'</div>
<div class="p">The band will snapâ€”another testament</div>
<div class="p">T' Almighty God's original intent.</div>
<div class="p">Unwinding like a coiled wand of birch,</div>
<div class="p">It'll point a finger, back to the old Church.</div>
