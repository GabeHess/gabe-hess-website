I"ñ<div class="p">The interstates with many a lane of traffic</div>
<div class="p">Of a great nation cherish oil-packed throngs:</div>
<div class="p">Today they may boast of their demographic</div>
<div class="p">Dear to their heart, though not by rumbling songs;</div>
<div class="p">For through the many byways cleft in prongs,</div>
<div class="p">The tortuous parade of matchbox cars,</div>
<div class="p">Though grand view sweeps the vista all along</div>
<div class="p">No dislocated blot of motion jars.</div>
<div class="p">The single-compassed engines near and far</div>
<div class="p">All through the land are still, and clamor too</div>
<div class="p">Of creatures hearkening to their lodestar</div>
<div class="p">Is silent as the wind-abandoned flue.</div>
<div class="p">No cheerful bird enlivens with a coo</div>
<div class="p">The rite of worship, when with one accord</div>
<div class="p">The vital motion dies down yonder through-</div>
<div class="p">Way yearning the grand altar of the Board,</div>
<div class="p">The giant Billboard, sponsor of all, toward.</div>
<div class="p">The silent vigil ceases, gears of state</div>
<div class="p">Kick into motion, list away the horde</div>
<div class="p">And once more rumble down the interstate.</div>
