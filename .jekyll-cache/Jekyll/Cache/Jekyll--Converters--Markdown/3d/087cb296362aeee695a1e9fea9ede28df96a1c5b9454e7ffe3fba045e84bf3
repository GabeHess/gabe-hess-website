I"8<div class="p">The flames expire on the streets of Rome;</div>
<div class="p">The ash of cities courses underfoot:</div>
<div class="p">I thread my way through tortured iron home,</div>
<div class="p">Avoiding where the lingering sinners loot.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The crackling glass recalls my wandering mind:</div>
<div class="p">The streets evolve with flitting, shadowy shades:</div>
<div class="p">They come, they go, unite, and flee their kind,</div>
<div class="p">As smoke, or phantoms in commerce with Hades.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">One ventures further forth into the light,</div>
<div class="p">Its face enameled with an ashen coat:</div>
<div class="p">Beneath the white, a streak of skin shows white,</div>
<div class="p">Where water termites bored a dusty moat.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">It disappears in the fantastic dance:</div>
<div class="p">The phantom city whirls round and around.</div>
<div class="p">A huddled family, does it necromance?</div>
<div class="p">Call spirits from the flames that hug the ground?</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">It clusters round a fire; little boy,</div>
<div class="p">Why moan, why piteously wail? A little cold</div>
<div class="p">In but the present, when Time will destroy</div>
<div class="p">Us wights of dust, will be a tale of old.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">I turn and thread my way through ruined brick,</div>
<div class="p">My ankle here caught on the rubble bed,</div>
<div class="p">The ashes falling, ashes waxing thick,</div>
<div class="p">As angels pound and stamp through, through my head.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The messengers of Chaos act a play,</div>
<div class="p">My skull resounding to the beating drum;</div>
<div class="p">I stop, I stumble, thread my homeward way,</div>
<div class="p">As tattered nerves composedly turn numb.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">My gate approaches, solitary, fleet:</div>
<div class="p">There yon my house is rubble on the ground;</div>
<div class="p">I stare a moment, turning, turn my feet</div>
<div class="p">Wherever harbor for the lost is found.</div>
