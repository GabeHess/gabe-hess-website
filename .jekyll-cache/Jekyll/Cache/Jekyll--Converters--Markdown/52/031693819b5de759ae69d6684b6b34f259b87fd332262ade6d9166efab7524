<div class="p">From Eastern levee-chambers faraway, the Sun</div>
<div class="p">Majestically surmounts the morning dark,</div>
<div class="p">Then sweeps in regal haste across the Occident,</div>
<div class="p">And conquers West on its accustomed arc.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">So does the Coiled One of far Eastern Lands ascend,</div>
<div class="p">To sweep inexorably o'er the West</div>
<div class="p">On wings encumbered with the weight of evil, but</div>
<div class="p">Somehow still with the warlike thing oppressed.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Ambitious to subdue the continents, and throned</div>
<div class="p">In vastness o'er dominions occupy</div>
<div class="p">The merciful seat in the subject sky, it stares</div>
<div class="p">And does the plain white capitol descry.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The Eastern Dragon, with its gemstone crusted hide,</div>
<div class="p">Sits on a plume and charges with a roar</div>
<div class="p">Whoever is defender of the Occident</div>
<div class="p">To meet with it in all-deciding war.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then from the West ascends an Eagle with a fierce</div>
<div class="p">And brazen visage, for the battle bred,</div>
<div class="p">To test by arms which august champion will lie</div>
<div class="p">In black disgrace and red-stained honor dead.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The Eagle soars, the Serpent falls a flight and strikes</div>
<div class="p">Below: the Eagle, caught up in a draft,</div>
<div class="p">Ascends and wheels to pluck the Serpent's diamond eyes</div>
<div class="p">From their hard setting with despiteful craft.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The Serpent flies loose, and on whorls of wind stays far</div>
<div class="p">From the pursuing Eagle full of wrath,</div>
<div class="p">And agitated not, yet cold but flustered, seeks</div>
<div class="p">For a maneuver, and veers from its path.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then with fantastic speed upon the land it flies,</div>
<div class="p">And comets trailing ice ne'er flew so fast,</div>
<div class="p">To lay in flames the various patterned earth below</div>
<div class="p">And have dominion of the earth at last.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">But see, the Eagle sheering down a different course,</div>
<div class="p">Descending, strikes the barely armored neck,</div>
<div class="p">Then eddies and the Serpent's underbelly soft</div>
<div class="p">Contrives to systematically peck.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The Serpent rears and calls in eldritch pain, but struck</div>
<div class="p">With lancing arrows everywhere it falls,</div>
<div class="p">Or so it seems to the now floundering immortal Snake,</div>
<div class="p">Which gently floats to earth and thereon sprawls.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">On earth it soon becomes a little kitchen Snake,</div>
<div class="p">And taken up in the great Eagle's beak</div>
<div class="p">Ascends to heaven, numb and twisting gaily still,</div>
<div class="p">Then as the Eagle sounds a joyful shriek,</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Falls once more and so breaks upon a clod of clay</div>
<div class="p">Sun-tempered, and the Western champion</div>
<div class="p">Wheels near the Sun and shouts exultingly,</div>
<div class="p">The noise ascending nearly to the Sun.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The conflict o'er, the Eagle proud, victorious</div>
<div class="p">Does swiftly fly and shrill the happy sound</div>
<div class="p">Of peace from cold majestic Serpents come to nest</div>
<div class="p">Where it on its triumphant flight is bound.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">But little serpents in the unabashÃ¨d East</div>
<div class="p">Stir far from where now lies their ancient sire</div>
<div class="p">Prostrated and sustaining worms, as they do court</div>
<div class="p">The ancient empire's all-supporting fire.</div>
