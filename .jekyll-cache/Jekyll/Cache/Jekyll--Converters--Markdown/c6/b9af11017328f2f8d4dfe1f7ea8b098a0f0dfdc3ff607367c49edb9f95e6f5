I".<div class="p">The great clouds stir with godlike, stately pace,
<div class="p">The wind plays tunes across my upturned face,
<div class="p">The waters ripple for as far as the eye can see,
<div class="p">And God will hear and grant my more than human plea.
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Ecstatic with the impulse, I withdraw my sight,
<div class="p">And turn to find all fast becoming night,
<div class="p">A steeple rises o'er the bricky, urban street,
<div class="p">And soft oblivion folds me to her bosom sweet.
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
