I"œ<div class="p">The beauty of a gnarled tree</div>
<div class="p">Surpasses that of all and else.</div>
<div class="p">His rivalsâ€”they are sought by me,</div>
<div class="p">But elude my sorry wit.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">I searched in flowers, fine and full,</div>
<div class="p">In sunsets over lakes pristine,</div>
<div class="p">But failed to find the eerie pull</div>
<div class="p">That waits on Oak, the mighty king.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">I searched 'mong humans, dashing, trim,</div>
<div class="p">And probed the stones by nature hewn;</div>
<div class="p">Their beauty paled before each limb</div>
<div class="p">That graced his frame with noble mood.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">I ope'd the door of feeling strong</div>
<div class="p">But found all passion wanting there,</div>
<div class="p">And thus perceived the lasting song</div>
<div class="p">Of twisted Oak, high thatch of air.</div>
