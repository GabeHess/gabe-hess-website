I"µ<div class="p">Modernity grows like a stalk</div>
<div class="p">That withers with every o'clock,</div>
<div class="p">And at its tip-top, less the base of the crop,</div>
<div class="p">Is powdered and yellow as chalk.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Modernity keels in decay,</div>
<div class="p">Its fountain releasing a fay,</div>
<div class="p">That flits from the base, as a purple disgrace,</div>
<div class="p">Too fretted and chivied to stay.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">This modern world is gone to seed;</div>
<div class="p">Plants many a pestilent weed,</div>
<div class="p">As spring its pale heirs into order's despairs</div>
<div class="p">That grow in a parvenu creed.</div>
