I"<div class="p">A stick, dipped in pitch, besmeared with vile tar,</div>
<div class="p">With feathers coated by the mass of men,</div>
<div class="p">His self-reflected virtue charms the pen</div>
<div class="p">Of fetters fallen from limbs; heads ajar;</div>
<div class="p">Brands flaming, held to the redundant scar</div>
<div class="p">Sunk deep in civil custom, civil ken;</div>
<div class="p">Wounds cauterized with the anarchist's yen,</div>
<div class="p">The madly flaming point seen from afar.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The merry man of France, the Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="p">Would exhume folly, down long-standing good.</div>
<div class="p">His gilded notions carried him to war:</div>
<div class="p">He slew the rich, to better slay the poor.</div>
