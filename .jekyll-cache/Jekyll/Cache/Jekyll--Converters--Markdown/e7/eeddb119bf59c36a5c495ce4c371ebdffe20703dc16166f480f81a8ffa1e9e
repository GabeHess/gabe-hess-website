I"ª<div class="p">A teazing, straying thought upon</div>
<div class="p">The thoughtful organ is withdrawn</div>
<div class="p">That peaceful stillness may assuage</div>
<div class="p">My frenzied furnace, blackened page;</div>
<div class="p">The hair that tickles comes again,</div>
<div class="p">The poignant bubbles of champagne;</div>
<div class="p">They rob hope's fruitful hours spent</div>
<div class="p">At cosseting poetic bent.</div>
<div class="p">For flames engulf the public square,</div>
<div class="p">And heads are fired with fret and care,</div>
<div class="p">The bricks are torn from private niche</div>
<div class="p">Where one had roughed off literary itch.</div>
