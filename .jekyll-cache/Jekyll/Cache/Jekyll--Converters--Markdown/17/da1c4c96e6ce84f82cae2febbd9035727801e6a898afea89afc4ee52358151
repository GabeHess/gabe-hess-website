<div class="p">E'er rises from the lowest realm and creed</div>
<div class="p">To strike her heel, of trouble bound, her seed.</div>
<div class="p">With vile thoughts—feared by birth: instinctive ken—</div>
<div class="p">From fest'ring pit, the piled cousins' den,</div>
<div class="p">The lonely urban-dweller, brooding weed,</div>
<div class="p">Through wormwood, gall, embittered aniseed—</div>
<div class="p">The serpent, mouth agape—glides and again.</div>

<div class="p">Strife, drizzling trouble tremble at his bite;</div>
<div class="p">Distended with pride, with unleavened joy,</div>
<div class="p">Leap they cap'ring—O Bacchus, what a sight!</div>
<div class="p">The snake withdraws from Fortune's hapless toy.</div>
