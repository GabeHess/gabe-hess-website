I"R<div class="p">A lolling sophist in a mound</div>
<div class="p">Of gooey flesh, produced a sound</div>
<div class="p">Spewed over words, words limed to catch</div>
<div class="p">A lovely feather come to perch;</div>
<div class="p">It fell in sticky rags to earth,</div>
<div class="p">And flopped in breathless throes of mirth.</div>
<div class="p">Expression smug like finger paint</div>
<div class="p">Adorned with an unpleasant taint</div>
<div class="p">A swollen face—smeared, smeared across</div>
<div class="p">Those features—seeming dross on dross!</div>
<div class="p">The nose had grunted, chortled from</div>
<div class="p">Its depth a mounting earthquake—mum—</div>
<div class="p">The gross lips curled, and loosed a laugh</div>
<div class="p">That brayed forth like a gizzard's gaffe.</div>
<div class="p">Contempt in vain met language big</div>
<div class="p">With fruits of dripping, purple fig,</div>
<div class="p">And bursting cherry 'bout to rot,</div>
<div class="p">With hard surprise still in its grot;</div>
<div class="p">A rancid watermelon sluiced</div>
<div class="p">Juice yellow with expression loosed</div>
<div class="p">From cynic's mouth past bloated tongue,</div>
<div class="p">A flatfish, organ of a young</div>
<div class="p">And healthy monster in a swamp</div>
<div class="p">Of boorish and revolting pomp.</div>
