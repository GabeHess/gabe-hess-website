I"_<div class="p">'No man a foe or enemy</div>
<div class="p">It stands to reason patently</div>
<div class="p">We can call, even silently,</div>
<div class="p">Or can say surely is.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">'For all men, as you see, are blind</div>
<div class="p">And know not what, know not wherein</div>
<div class="p">They serve their brothers kind in kind</div>
<div class="p">And corporately sin.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">'But even if I thought they knew</div>
<div class="p">In cloudy or uncertain ways,</div>
<div class="p">I nonetheless would say 'tis true</div>
<div class="p">That to be angry never pays.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">'And, furthermore, temptation strong</div>
<div class="p">Too often causes oversight:</div>
<div class="p">If one does inadvertent wrong,</div>
<div class="p">He wanted, really, to do right.'</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Thus John was told by morally</div>
<div class="p">Adjusted men that manfully</div>
<div class="p">He should not act: utility</div>
<div class="p">Is all that rightly is.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">In time he answered swift and low:</div>
<div class="p">'I'll try to love the sinner though</div>
<div class="p">I'll simply not try not to know</div>
<div class="p">That he a sinner is.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">'I'll gladly try to understand</div>
<div class="p">Extenuations, trauma, or</div>
<div class="p">Psychology, a complex, and</div>
<div class="p">A childhood much too poor.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">'But I will pay a compliment:</div>
<div class="p">For nonetheless I think that men</div>
<div class="p">Can sin and do so with intent,</div>
<div class="p">And sinning once, yet sin again.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">'I'll hate the world, or hate the sin,</div>
<div class="p">And hating sin, I'll never cease</div>
<div class="p">To challenge evil, fight, and win,</div>
<div class="p">For truly evil's all a-piece.'</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">And though they said, 'Enough of woe,'</div>
<div class="p">He stubbornly refused to know</div>
<div class="p">That heroism is a throe</div>
<div class="p">That rightly is no more.</div>
