I"}<div class="p">"My name is Gabe," I said and then</div>
<div class="p">Took up the blackest of my pens,</div>
<div class="p">To write it down and be assured</div>
<div class="p">That two plus two must equal four.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To call it "chance" would be a crime,</div>
<div class="p">"Coincidence" a cockney rhyme.</div>
<div class="p">A "cosmic joke" it surely was</div>
<div class="p">When pigs take to the air like doves.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">If to "illusion" life must go</div>
<div class="p">Then surely we are prey to woe;</div>
<div class="p">But if confusion cannot be</div>
<div class="p">Our hearts are surely light and free.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">So to the Good I set my mind;</div>
<div class="p">Evil I shall leave behind;</div>
<div class="p">And at the void I'll surely laugh,</div>
<div class="p">Traverse, instead, the Joyous Path.</div>
