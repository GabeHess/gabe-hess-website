I"‹<div class="p">The wimpled peaks, pecked bare by raptorsâ€™ beaks,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WingÃ¨d emblems of the four-cornered breath,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stand stately in defiance of the scampâ€™ring pace of life;</div>
<div class="p">The days and weeks, but most of all the weeks,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Month and season guiding the hand of death;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And years they mock, the gravity of strife.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">But though my slender bones and flesh tender</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Invite thee to chortle, to chuckle, laugh,</div>
<div class="p">Thy mirth, Mountain, is froth, for thy splendor</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will never grace a mortal epitaph.</div>
