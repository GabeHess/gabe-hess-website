I"•<div class="p">Shall I praise the temper of the day?</div>
<div class="p">Suppose the gloomy dusk a day shot with red?</div>
<div class="p">The red of morn, no symptom of decay;</div>
<div class="p">Blood red but gentled: with hues, with pinks, with light;</div>
<div class="p">Spread o'er with the whimsy of a bird's flight?</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Shall I praise the temper of the dusk?</div>
<div class="p">Extol diffusions of a malignant dark?</div>
<div class="p">Which bind the lungs in a billow of musk;</div>
<div class="p">And still the motions of a heart rich in blood</div>
<div class="p">With expanding oppressions of a darksome flood?</div>
