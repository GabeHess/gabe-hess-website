I"%	<div class="p">Entrapped as ice the morning air was caught:</div>
<div class="p">Void-filling aether, gelid in suspense,</div>
<div class="p">With pinioned laces, with a fine broach wrought</div>
<div class="p">Into an altogether different tense;</div>
<div class="p">As substance held, as cockled medium,</div>
<div class="p">Disturbing wash of wind-swept tedium—</div>
<div class="p">Not wind itself, not breath, not this!</div>
<div class="p">This muse of matter, from form brought—made dense;</div>
<div class="p">To be but shattered by the hammer's kiss.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The gavel tapped, traversing arc-drawn space,</div>
<div class="p">To touch the features of environs bound,</div>
<div class="p">To mar—disfigure—aether's frozen face,</div>
<div class="p">Terrestrial endurance thus to sound:</div>
<div class="p">Will earthly polish crack beneath the blow</div>
<div class="p">Which struck brisk aether's fine-edged shards aglow?</div>
<div class="p">Do galaxies explode?—It seems they must,</div>
<div class="p">Lest clusters past unnumbered soon compound.</div>
<div class="p">They burst and smoke away in clouds of rust.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">As galaxies it seems the air must break.</div>
<div class="p">The moment, rifting not mere sky but earth,</div>
<div class="p">Knows consequence: as Venus struck the lake,</div>
<div class="p">A rain of beauty causing beauty's birth.</div>
<div class="p">The show'ring droplets, plasma-tipped, defy</div>
<div class="p">Late-emptied space their jail to make the sky!</div>
<div class="p">They fall—or do they not essay the soil?</div>
<div class="p">The earth though fallow in well-seeded dearth</div>
<div class="p">Must surely crack and join galactic moil.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Yet order held, as slivers keeled away</div>
<div class="p">To lapidate the earth then later rise;</div>
<div class="p">Thaw redispersing with the constant day,</div>
<div class="p">To thus replenish and reclothe the skies.</div>
<div class="p">The morning, without cov'ring, without breath;</div>
<div class="p">The early hours, breathless, wrapped rude sons of Seth</div>
<div class="p">In dainty fragrance, feel defined by naught,</div>
<div class="p">A delicate effluvium of sighs,</div>
<div class="p">From pollen-sippers' vital cloisters brought.</div>
