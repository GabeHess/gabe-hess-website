I"Ò<div class="p">Beset by noise, surrounded by a play</div>
<div class="p">Of circus colors, flaming all aroundâ€”</div>
<div class="p">What thrilling hues! what reams and glints of gray!â€”</div>
<div class="p">Thus, thus stand I, perched on a raft of ground.</div>
<div class="p">Dilations burst with the alarming sound</div>
<div class="p">Of static on the air, of random noise:</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">These bubbles grow on spume to ripe fruition,</div>
<div class="p">Then by the strain must break their perfect round,</div>
<div class="p">My wits to puzzle in my lone condition.</div>
<div class="p">'Tis such, it is all about in oceansâ€”</div>
<div class="p">A vast, comprising sea of small commotions.</div>
