I"+<div class="p">What has availed when proximately pressed</div>
<div class="p">A rustic shanty-dweller, brave and best</div>
<div class="p">For leagues around at tending to himself,</div>
<div class="p">Is pressed in service by a late-style Guelph?</div>
<div class="p">He fights, with tooth and claw, with words and rocks,</div>
<div class="p">And fleers white feathers from close-pressing flocks,</div>
<div class="p">And flings white flurries on the traitorous breeze,</div>
<div class="p">In hopes their weakness 'll make 'em squint or sneeze.</div>
<div class="p">But swarming feathers choke his bold attack,</div>
<div class="p">And adversaries importune his back,</div>
<div class="p">Till he exhales asphyxiated breath,</div>
<div class="p">Limbers stiff knees both, and dissembles death.</div>
<div class="p">They pack him on a feathered gurney thence,</div>
<div class="p">A farthing hero, stubborn in defense;</div>
<div class="p">They lay him on a barrack's frigid floor,</div>
<div class="p">Where when he wakes, he'll make straight for the door...</div>
