I"®<div class="p">Drunk on the wine of blood, these men</div>
<div class="p">Aspired aloft on the chairs of an inn</div>
<div class="p">That in times of their fathers a city had been,</div>
<div class="p">Now merely the stage of a bestial shout</div>
<div class="p">That smote, like the sight of his lord father's ghost</div>
<div class="p">The prince of the Danes, the high angel-host.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">They swore, these men, to eclipse the day,</div>
<div class="p">To occlude the regime of an earlier time.</div>
<div class="p">So they chanted the words of a children's rhyme,</div>
<div class="p">Kept time with the stamp of a thousand feet,</div>
<div class="p">Rose high but to fall in the motion of waves</div>
<div class="p">Or a swell that the beaches of paradise laves.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">They swelled, surged, rose and fell</div>
<div class="p">Over the ruins of a side-street pub,</div>
<div class="p">While a song, as from wings that the cricket-bugs rub,</div>
<div class="p">From the throats of a thousand men dying in prayer,</div>
<div class="p">In a corpus transcending corporeal flesh,</div>
<div class="p">Arched over the scene like a rete of mesh.</div>
