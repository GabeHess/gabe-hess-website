I"Z<div class="p">A generation whined. What riches sprung,</div>
<div class="p">Warmed by the sickly breath of academic brats,</div>
<div class="p">Rank with the nauseous odor of proliferous sprats</div>
<div class="p">That pour forth gratis from disgustful lungs,</div>
<div class="p">And youth infect by instrument of tongues,</div>
<div class="p">Who bless the infant world with happy growth and gall,</div>
<div class="p">With haste and hunger to o'er-sicken heaven, earth, all:</div>
<div class="p">Their pleasure plundered from a hole sans bung</div>
<div class="p">That housed amazing virtues, who would want or need?—</div>
<div class="p">A thousand gross degenerates raise hue and cry,</div>
<div class="p">And argue for their desperate sense, and "Who but I?"</div>
<div class="p">They say. For why? We had great need. Indeed?—</div>
<div class="p">What riches sprouted from promiscuous mead</div>
<div class="p">Of all-originating silty soils below,</div>
<div class="p">And wrapped all heaven and earth with their twined ivy throe,</div>
<div class="p">And by their halter many things are dead.</div>
