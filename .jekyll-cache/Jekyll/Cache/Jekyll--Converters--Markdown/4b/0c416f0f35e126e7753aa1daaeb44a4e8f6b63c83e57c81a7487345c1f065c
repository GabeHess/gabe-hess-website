I"@<div class="p">I skied the slopes of misery;</div>
<div class="p">I matched him eye for eye.</div>
<div class="p">Each twist and turn I took with ease;</div>
<div class="p">Each up and down met stifled laugh,</div>
<div class="p">And then a question: namely, "Why?"</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Why brave the path circuitous,</div>
<div class="p">The halfpipe of wronged fate;</div>
<div class="p">Vacation in the pharaoh's land;</div>
<div class="p">Or eat an oyster dappled grey?</div>
<div class="p">But soft!—a prayer: namely, "Wait."</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Wait, I urge, before you rank</div>
<div class="p">The fortune of man's every mood.</div>
<div class="p">Man would have fire, would he not?</div>
<div class="p">With fire, then, some man must play,</div>
<div class="p">And hang upon his nature's rood.</div>
