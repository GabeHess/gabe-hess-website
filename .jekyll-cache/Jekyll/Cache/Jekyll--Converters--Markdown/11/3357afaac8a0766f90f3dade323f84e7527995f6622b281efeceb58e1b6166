I"Ï<div class="p">"How's that?" I said, and unclosed one more inch</div>
<div class="p">My brown wood door with great bronze knocker, so</div>
<div class="p">The agent claiming privilege to know</div>
<div class="p">The petty trivia of my very life,</div>
<div class="p">And business details, and so through strife</div>
<div class="p">Conduct myself, with rough and iron cinch,</div>
<div class="p">Could lay on the doorstep of my chateau,</div>
<div class="p">As at a murderer's trial a bloody knife,</div>
<div class="p">Where evidence before was even rife,</div>
<div class="p">His claim to be a busybody now.</div>
<div class="p">He said, "'Tis true. Though to forfend a row,</div>
<div class="p">We peace or freedom mingily bestow,</div>
<div class="p">Despite the cavils of yourself and wife,</div>
<div class="p">We shall no further liberty allow,</div>
<div class="p">But have you to our each inspection bow,</div>
<div class="p">Then at the gentle urging of a hint</div>
<div class="p">Straight down the lines of proper process sprint,</div>
<div class="p">As Hamelin's rats or children chased a fife.</div>
<div class="p">Your life does in my resolution lie,</div>
<div class="p">And will proceed 'neath my uncanny eye,</div>
<div class="p">And nothing done is foreign to my sight,</div>
<div class="p">For to observe the world is my birthright";</div>
<div class="p">And so continued prating, but in vain:</div>
<div class="p">I said, "Good day," and shut the door again.</div>
