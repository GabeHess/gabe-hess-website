<div class="p">Where Vice is contraband</div>
<div class="p">And all the Nation's hordes of mice</div>
<div class="p">And eagles soaring high on wings</div>
<div class="p">Are Brothers bound in the blood</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Unseated Kings;</div>
<div class="p">In this Place of Virtue's men,</div>

<div class="p">This place of empty seeing pews,</div>
<div class="p">Of Darkness Ruptured yet again</div>
<div class="p">And Trees that need not ever bud</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor move a pen;</div>
<div class="p">In this Realm of Higher Thought</div>

<div class="p">Who'd Mentioned that they'd Not Be Bought</div>

<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never fought,</div>
<div class="p">One thing was odd and oddly wrong:</div>
<div class="p">The Streets were empty, they say because</div>
<div class="p">There sounded still a nameless Purr.</div>
<div class="p">But lo! there walks a lost known songâ€”</div>
<div class="p">He paces up and down;</div>
<div class="p">Round him flocks the curtained throng;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He smiles a Curfewed frown.</div>
