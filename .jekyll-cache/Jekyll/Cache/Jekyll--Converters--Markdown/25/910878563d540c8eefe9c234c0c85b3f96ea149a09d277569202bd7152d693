I"¯g<div class="p">What federation of celestial signs</div>
<div class="p">Could breed the strange brainsickness of our times?</div>
<div class="p">Could stars in riots, or moons in revolt,</div>
<div class="p">Inspire man to reproduce a dolt?</div>
<div class="p">Could heaven guide our blockhead through the day,</div>
<div class="p">Then strike his block with an enkindling ray?</div>
<div class="p">These mysteries profound, not ours to ask,</div>
<div class="p">But lead us t'ward a more propitious task.</div>
<div class="p">The cause obscure, th' effect becomes our lot.</div>
<div class="p">Soâ€”mark this imbecility we've got.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A clown on horseback rises to the throne:</div>
<div class="p">The public with a sympathetic groan,</div>
<div class="p">Red-eyed and wild in countenance, appears</div>
<div class="p">To snivel on the shoulders of its peers.</div>
<div class="p">Hear wailing in the streets! see ash-marked brows,</div>
<div class="p">Air thrilling with grief-wrung regrets and vows.</div>
<div class="p">A thousand feet descend upon the Hill,</div>
<div class="p">A thousand voices swear they're treated ill.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But fires tempestuous storming through the years,</div>
<div class="p">The Furies rioting, and volunteers,</div>
<div class="p">Exhaust a pen too quickly; therefore, this</div>
<div class="p">Theme I address, but only to dismiss.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead their cause I purpose to explain,</div>
<div class="p">And plumb the tortuous circuits of their brain.</div>
<div class="p">Invoke the Muse, for, Goddess! what a task!</div>
<div class="p">To straighten mazes, which is what I ask:</div>
<div class="p">Though by thine inspiration realized,</div>
<div class="p">Oh faithless me! were 't done I'd be surprised.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lunatics believeâ€”by way of anchorâ€”</div>
<div class="p">That Marx was wrong: the trouble's not the banker.</div>
<div class="p">Rich man, and poor, all have a color of face;</div>
<div class="p">Therefore, the problem is the culprit's race.</div>
<div class="p">Now follow closelyâ€”else, be warned! be lost,</div>
<div class="p">And lost, a sacrifice to the dull host.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They say, as venom cures the venomous wound,</div>
<div class="p">Snake eating snake, in circles to confound;</div>
<div class="p">As flus are treated from the germs we sneeze,</div>
<div class="p">Are antidotes distilled from the disease.</div>
<div class="p">Thus fire fire; stone on stone; sword meeting sword;</div>
<div class="p">Against a throne a throne; and word on wordâ€”</div>
<div class="p">One wrong another sets to right: the scales</div>
<div class="p">Rebalance, and the blinkered god prevails.</div>
<div class="p">Is race-talk evil? double race-talk o'er,</div>
<div class="p">And bring the evil discourse more and more.</div>
<div class="p">Are barriers to the bearers of a skin</div>
<div class="p">Called, delicately, everything but sin?</div>
<div class="p">Then double barriers, and pound each post:</div>
<div class="p">The <em>other</em> race is outside is our boast.</div>
<div class="p">Each crime redouble, and each wrong repay,</div>
<div class="p">And maybe we shall see a race-free day!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A German Genius, wrapt in thought profound,</div>
<div class="p">Philosophizing o'er the Sacred Ground,</div>
<div class="p">Ne'er stole by cunning, from the vast abyss,</div>
<div class="p">Such logic and philosophy as this!</div>
<div class="p">Behold the reason! is it sound? ye judge!</div>
<div class="p">Be warned that German logic ne'er will budge.</div>
<div class="p">But wait! the temple vibrates with a thought:</div>
<div class="p">Perhaps there's truth in what they've always taught!</div>
<div class="p">Perhaps the white man is the scourge of good,</div>
<div class="p">A truth that we have never understood!</div>
<div class="p">Perhaps there dwells, like serpents in the breast,</div>
<div class="p">The Devil's brood, tongues lashing at th' opprest,</div>
<div class="p">In Fifty States and all across the West.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then bow, pale serpent, to thy virgin brotherâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Repent, bad man, for 'n achromatic mother!</div>
<div class="p">Too often thou hast rid our backsâ€”but bend,</div>
<div class="p">And with the weight of Africa contend.</div>
<div class="p">Pure Africa, where zephyrs on the breeze,</div>
<div class="p">Too innocent to carry a disease,</div>
<div class="p">Blow through the hair of a princess decked in flowers,</div>
<div class="p">And call forth the rejuvenating powers;</div>
<div class="p">Where life and health dance twain and never sleep;</div>
<div class="p">The font of youth sinks in the grassland deep;</div>
<div class="p">Where gentle creatures gaze beside a stream</div>
<div class="p">Into pure trickling waters sweet as cream;</div>
<div class="p">Where elegant giraffes and meerkats roam,</div>
<div class="p">And wildebeests and mambas make their home.</div>
<div class="p">When lo! the blasted atmospheres of Europe</div>
<div class="p">Swept in with words more cloying-sweet than syrup:</div>
<div class="p">"Sell us your kind"â€”they saidâ€”"and with gold coin,</div>
<div class="p">Thus commerce opens and our races join."</div>
<div class="p">Th' innocent natives of that virgin clime,</div>
<div class="p">As now, so then, no better either time</div>
<div class="p">Had means to know! for how to know that sin,</div>
<div class="p">The white man's curse, had lately entered in!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, the Christian spirit bids thee know</div>
<div class="p">(Priest get thee down! we invoke thee but for show!)</div>
<div class="p">That white men are the source of guilt and crime;</div>
<div class="p">The rest, poor others! fall for 't every time.</div>
<div class="p">Their culture of oppression weighs like sand</div>
<div class="p">On the poor visage of the helpless strand.</div>
<div class="p">Their racist "reason" and Semitic "science"</div>
<div class="p">Invite the righteous anger of defiance.</div>
<div class="p">And white men's "objectivity," you know,</div>
<div class="p">Is the persuasion of the <em>status quo</em>.</div>
<div class="p">For hum! I know the horrid virtue not:</div>
<div class="p">Is "objectivity" the best you've got?</div>
<div class="p">Though ample years pass, I refuse to think!</div>
<div class="p">My brain has no grey matter but is pink.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For law of discourse only you denies:</div>
<div class="p">A hint suffices to instruct the wise:</div>
<div class="p">Thou sayst one race, nor for the future plan,</div>
<div class="p">Nor turn a figure, nor exert them, can:</div>
<div class="p">What! man! a racist! Looks like I was right!</div>
<div class="p">If I do it: stay silent! thou art white.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Race is the causeâ€”the grand conspiracy,</div>
<div class="p">Foundation for the whole hypocrisy,</div>
<div class="p">Umbrella stretching o'er most every issue,</div>
<div class="p">The fabric of our meaning, and the tissue.</div>
<div class="p">Race is the cause uniting several fights,</div>
<div class="p">And ours the glory! when there 're no more whites.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Barbarian tribes upon the gates now press:</div>
<div class="p">"Hold up!" she cries, "a chance t' our theory test!"</div>
<div class="p">Needless to say, on such occasions past,</div>
<div class="p">The Vandals wishes were consulted last.</div>
<div class="p">But then men thoughtâ€”who knows what thought then menâ€”</div>
<div class="p">But I have heard droll things were thought back then!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hungry legions press upon the gates,</div>
<div class="p">A roiling flood with vengeance ne'er abates:</div>
<div class="p">But this Tsunami has a legal team,</div>
<div class="p">Who cry, "Good Heavens, can't a person Dream?"</div>
<div class="p">Unreason rises, and the Man in Orange,</div>
<div class="p">Unparalleledâ€”as that word is in rhymeâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Shuts to the gate, and cries, "No, not today,"</div>
<div class="p">And at the word two millions faint away.</div>
<div class="p">And screams affright the birds that nest on high,</div>
<div class="p">As everywhere the loons pretend to die;</div>
<div class="p">Sad fortune! that they'll not maintain their sleep,</div>
<div class="p">But rise again, to protest, and to weep.</div>
<div class="p">The Dutch build dikes to stop the pressing drink;</div>
<div class="p">That we do likewise is racist, I think.</div>
<div class="p">Throw wide the gates! ye Dutch, embrace the flood:</div>
<div class="p">And we too shall not stubbornly seclude.</div>
<div class="p">Bathe in the sea! disport in salt-sea wash!</div>
<div class="p">We frolic in the tide, and dip, and plash.</div>
<div class="p">Why stem the tide or not the mass invite?</div>
<div class="p">It can but be because your skin is white!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The colleges, where cheerful colors are</div>
<div class="p">On blazing wheels, round the professor's chair,</div>
<div class="p">Disporting sent, the rainbow wide to cross,</div>
<div class="p">Themselves with hues of spectrums to emboss;</div>
<div class="p">Where cuckoos sing; by subtle calculation,</div>
<div class="p">White's black, black's white; would have it immigration</div>
<div class="p">No trouble causes, with the nation past,</div>
<div class="p">The Globe united: Wilson's dream at last!</div>
<div class="p">Conjoined in love the nation-states are one.</div>
<div class="p">Another good idea! When's it done?</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The colleges ideas spawn like frogs,</div>
<div class="p">Which hop in numbers to the nation's Bogs,</div>
<div class="p">And sow the Swamp with one more Master Plan</div>
<div class="p">To kill a country or to carry on.</div>
<div class="p">Across the hallway, calmer heads resist,</div>
<div class="p">And in the classroom raise a calmer fist.</div>
<div class="p">Some Men of Science, disconcerted by</div>
<div class="p">The numbers, creeping bit by bit too high,</div>
<div class="p">Chastise the wanton reckless pace to Heaven,</div>
<div class="p">Though our excesses surely are forgiven.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A cloud swings low, by some dark angel sent;</div>
<div class="p">A scowling visage marks its ill intent.</div>
<div class="p">The Men of Science, eager for its flight,</div>
<div class="p">Observe and mutter, "Something here's not right."</div>
<div class="p">They ponder for a century, then inform</div>
<div class="p">The world, in purple darkness, soon a storm</div>
<div class="p">Of awesome magnitude, could strike, lay waste;</div>
<div class="p">They speak with faces to the windows prest;</div>
<div class="p">Snug in their college, the professors say,</div>
<div class="p">A hand stuck out, "It seems like Tribes today."</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One half a moment torn, great thoughts collide:</div>
<div class="p">He rushed unbuttoned to the battle's side;</div>
<div class="p">The storm clouds lowered, racing overhead;</div>
<div class="p">He picked among the bodies of the dead.</div>
<div class="p">Then with a voice pitched high, at last he spoke,</div>
<div class="p">But was so breathless it came out a croak.</div>
<div class="p">He wheezed, and flapped, and clutched his hair, and cried,</div>
<div class="p">"For Heaven ceaseâ€”I've studied the divide!</div>
<div class="p">And could inform, if ye'd but understand,</div>
<div class="p">'T is Tribalism that lays waste our land!"</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Needless to say, professor was ignored,</div>
<div class="p">No soul regarded, the commanders snored;</div>
<div class="p">He flapped in vain, then narrowly a flight</div>
<div class="p">Of arrows dodging, flew the bitter fight.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let bird eat bird, and let professors fly</div>
<div class="p">Around the Universe, then coming nigh,</div>
<div class="p">Discover something in the world's amiss,</div>
<div class="p">Then as we fight, inform us it is <em>this</em>;</div>
<div class="p">Then squawk and flee; the battle rages on,</div>
<div class="p">The moon does orbit, and flames forth the sun.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But law and order, too, are on the slate,</div>
<div class="p">Or, so to speak, the chopping-block of Fate.</div>
<div class="p">Policeâ€”who knew!â€”through history have been</div>
<div class="p">The only cause of crime, bad taste, and sin!</div>
<div class="p">Once gone, the order of the stars at last</div>
<div class="p">Descends, and we In Unity are blest.</div>
<div class="p">Police and criminal lie down abed,</div>
<div class="p">The meek and mighty, side by side (and dead).</div>
<div class="p">They bump their elbows, peer receiving peer,</div>
<div class="p">And with the gesture lay to rest all fear.</div>
<div class="p">A raging husband, snorting, fuming, stamping,</div>
<div class="p">Forever coming and fore'er decamping,</div>
<div class="p">Lowers his head to charge upon his wife:</div>
<div class="p">Enter a social worker! to save her life.</div>
<div class="p">Three moments pass, a scuffle churns the dust,</div>
<div class="p">A scream is heard, the air is torn by "Trust!"</div>
<div class="p">Then clears the dustâ€”Oh Goddess! light and singâ€”</div>
<div class="p">The worker leads the bull by the nose ring!</div>
<div class="p">A fortnight passes; husband takes a course</div>
<div class="p">On how to foster feelings of remorse.</div>
<div class="p">Domestic bliss returns, and husband, wife,</div>
<div class="p">And social worker are good friends for life.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A UCLA worker, multiplied,</div>
<div class="p">And cloned in school, a homeless drunkard spied:</div>
<div class="p">Into the institution! where discreet</div>
<div class="p">Attendants oft assure they are no threat.</div>
<div class="p">The days pass by, the weeks a door behind,</div>
<div class="p">And then the drunk emerges, and is fine!</div>
<div class="p">How easy, and we never knew before</div>
<div class="p">What wonders could occur behind a door.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No need for prisons: shaved and tattooed skulls,</div>
<div class="p">Eyes glaring, gnashing teeth, an arm that kills</div>
<div class="p">Cocoon-like shroud a butterfly-like soul,</div>
<div class="p">That will emerge as knock-kneed as a foal.</div>
<div class="p">Strip off the dead, gray skin, the sweat and grime,</div>
<div class="p">A beautiful soul steps forth every time.</div>
<div class="p">The thugs take yoga, and the thugs emerge,</div>
<div class="p">The only odd thing is that crime rates surge!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Heaven's gates souls of th' elect are scourged;</div>
<div class="p">So are we of our sins and vices purged:</div>
<div class="p">The sin of dragging by the ankles down,</div>
<div class="p">And vice of drowning, brothers black and brown.</div>
<div class="p">Purgation is our lot, till with rough time</div>
<div class="p">The Globe is cleansed of staining guilt and grime.</div>
<div class="p">Of course purgation is no pleasing thing,</div>
<div class="p">But others profit by our suffering.</div>
<div class="p">The sweat is wrung, flung off at every lash,</div>
<div class="p">And mildly red with blood, and grey with ash.</div>
<div class="p">The straining rack an instrument does make</div>
<div class="p">Of limbs of ours, which when they're played they ache;</div>
<div class="p">Strummed they produce exquisite agony,</div>
<div class="p">And bureaucrats enjoy the melody.</div>
<div class="p">However, thank Heaven the authorities</div>
<div class="p">Assure we're succoring minorities!</div>
<div class="p">But raise a hand infirmly to resist:</div>
<div class="p">Why stop that! hey! you racist man, desist!</div>
<div class="p">Bear with it! law and order are unfair,</div>
<div class="p">And other races like it thusâ€”so there!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much for that. The world would be much better</div>
<div class="p">If everyone would worry 'bout the weather.</div>
<div class="p">The crisis looms, the clock ticks on apace,</div>
<div class="p">And anxious experts watch the solar face.</div>
<div class="p">In twelve short years, the heavens gape and rain</div>
<div class="p">A sulfurous torrent on the spume-flecked main;</div>
<div class="p">The fire of Heaven, when chasms yawn on earth,</div>
<div class="p">Is met with equal fire thus given birth.</div>
<div class="p">Mankind, awake! lest in the jaws of fire</div>
<div class="p">Our businessmen and bureaucrats perspire;</div>
<div class="p">Lest all is death. For we'll be caught off guard,</div>
<div class="p">Unless we join the Climate Change Canard!</div>
<div class="p">And when the sea accretes into the sky,</div>
<div class="p">And creatures writhe, turn, leap a leap, and die,</div>
<div class="p">One race for sure will suffer more from death,</div>
<div class="p">And each draw an unequal dying breath.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another issue, folks: the point of hues</div>
<div class="p">That decorate the sky with reds and blues,</div>
<div class="p">Sustain the rainbow, and obscure the sun,</div>
<div class="p">And cast a different light on everyone.</div>
<div class="p">This world of ours, cast in a light so queer,</div>
<div class="p">Has spectrums that proliferate and sear</div>
<div class="p">With burning brilliance upon the heart</div>
<div class="p">Of man such colors in ecstatic art:</div>
<div class="p">Here bluish-purple, green, banana peach,</div>
<div class="p">Pink, yellow, Prussian red, Dutch orange each</div>
<div class="p">Flung high upon the canvas of the skies,</div>
<div class="p">Each cockeyed color common sense belies.</div>
<div class="p">Are races free? Oh! free the spectrum too,</div>
<div class="p">For everybody loves a parvenu.</div>
<div class="p">Two issues hand in hand go round the place,</div>
<div class="p">And race relies on rainbows, bows on race.</div>
<div class="p">Where but one color, man or woman, X,</div>
<div class="p">Or miscellaneous member of a sex,</div>
<div class="p">Speaks not, or is not heard, do woes descend,</div>
<div class="p">And the vast fabric of our nation rend;</div>
<div class="p">Which rent our country scarcely will survive,</div>
<div class="p">For we depend on every X alive;</div>
<div class="p">And sure the queer black trans community</div>
<div class="p">Is the backbone of our Democracy.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fate of earth is wobbling back and forth</div>
<div class="p">Upon the scales, a massive weight of earth.</div>
<div class="p">It leans and totters, mounting high, now low,</div>
<div class="p">Deciding glory and deciding woe.</div>
<div class="p">Decision dreadful! here the woe, one thinks,</div>
<div class="p">Subsides, but then the glory rather sinks.</div>
<div class="p">Then glorious in the sky! the Covenant Bow</div>
<div class="p">Mounts high and puts an end to earthly woe!</div>
<div class="p">The Rainbow's Triumph, o'er the region dry,</div>
<div class="p">Assures no flood when plaintive idiots cry.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then creatures of the wood bower and the glen</div>
<div class="p">With shrieks of joy around the maypole, then</div>
<div class="p">In floods into the streets, and through the land,</div>
<div class="p">Go shouting, dancing, and go hand in hand.</div>
<div class="p">See and believe! (apparently they do)</div>
<div class="p">That man can be a seal or kangaroo,</div>
<div class="p">Or fall upon a spectrum, marked by X,</div>
<div class="p">And thus belong to an indefinite sex,</div>
<div class="p">Then marry with another X, permute</div>
<div class="p">Times ten the genders, which were absolute.</div>
<div class="p">Poor innocents! but let them, as they will,</div>
<div class="p">Feast on the marrow of the hour's sweet kill,</div>
<div class="p">And contemplate what else is new in life</div>
<div class="p">Now man may have a spectrum for a wife.</div>
<div class="p">Ask not, tell not! ignore the canting mass</div>
<div class="p">Whene'er they make a laddie of a lass;</div>
<div class="p">And more absurd, more ripe to be ignored,</div>
<div class="p">For after time our humor's even bored.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By way of intermission from this magic,</div>
<div class="p">Take one sign of distraction, this one tragic.</div>
<div class="p">Who knows why women, men, and children will</div>
<div class="p">Tear though the country and distracted yell</div>
<div class="p">For rights to kill! to kill! to kill! Forgive,</div>
<div class="p">I always hate to see the babies live.</div>
<div class="p">For children are a nuisanceâ€”that must goâ€”</div>
<div class="p">And worlds declare the glorious reign of Roe.</div>
<div class="p">Exposed to die, the babies of the past,</div>
<div class="p">In bitter winter cried, and breathed their last,</div>
<div class="p">A healthful practice; but then gods inhaled</div>
<div class="p">Propitiating smoke when corn crops failed,</div>
<div class="p">Delightful essence of an infant child,</div>
<div class="p">BelovÃ¨d of the gods, when gods suspired.</div>
<div class="p">Abominable practice! Fools! who thought</div>
<div class="p">That strangled infants e'er could bring them aught!</div>
<div class="p">It brings them nothing, Margaret says, and smirks:</div>
<div class="p">We're more enlightened: when we do 't, it works.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In general, the way to justice bring,</div>
<div class="p">Is to abolish almost everything.</div>
<div class="p">To build up, tear down; so that men live free,</div>
<div class="p">Consign them to soul-crushing slavery.</div>
<div class="p">Justice be had! and everyone be judged</div>
<div class="p">According to the way they've been prejudged.</div>
<div class="p">Oppose the scheme? Why Nazi, get thee hence!</div>
<div class="p">I swear some people have no common sense.</div>
<div class="p">Karl Marx, however, is misunderstood,</div>
<div class="p">And he deserves a second chance at good.</div>
<div class="p">For honestly, does Science bid us cast</div>
<div class="p">Away hypotheses in wanton haste,</div>
<div class="p">Or does it rather bid us wax o'er cautious</div>
<div class="p">And ne'er dismiss what could prove efficacious?</div>
<div class="p">The consequences, if we soon dismiss,</div>
<div class="p">Are such as warn us not to judge amiss.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet some oppose. The dreary, formal sort</div>
<div class="p">Delight in standing novelty athwart,</div>
<div class="p">And from their lecterns ever breathe a blast</div>
<div class="p">That desiccated nations when it past.</div>
<div class="p">But lest the Tories with their silver spoon</div>
<div class="p">Set hard their teeth, we'll spend 'em to the moon!</div>
<div class="p">Then Marx descends, as bureaus necromance,</div>
<div class="p">And weeping beg, bestow a second chance.</div>
<div class="p">Deserving fellow. Marx, we must believe,</div>
<div class="p">One day on Earth a Heaven will achieve.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to effect this paradise,</div>
<div class="p">We must insist on dialogue precise.</div>
<div class="p">Let speech be free (all things be free) but if</div>
<div class="p">Some low down scoundrel or dog-eared caitiff</div>
<div class="p">Insists on speaking what we know is wrong,</div>
<div class="p">I promise, gentlemen, he won't speak long.</div>
<div class="p">Let speech be free, but let all speak the truth,</div>
<div class="p">Or munch on bitter herbs, and bathe in ruth.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's have a dialogue across the nation!</div>
<div class="p">Empowered by this National Conversation,</div>
<div class="p">A pound of heavy words will hit the man</div>
<div class="p">Who doesn't speak according to the plan.</div>
<div class="p">And some may speak, some better notâ€”unfair?</div>
<div class="p">The only standard here's a vicious pair.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if resistance stands athwart their cause,</div>
<div class="p">Affrights their covies, and repeals their laws,</div>
<div class="p">Their faces eerily lit with flaming wads</div>
<div class="p">Of dollars, dancing to their curious gods,</div>
<div class="p">With anger twisted on their lips, the brand</div>
<div class="p">They'll set to burning the entire land.</div>
<div class="p">Why would they do this? Goddess, I implore</div>
<div class="p">Illuminating song of thine once more.</div>
<div class="p">They'd whip the furious storm around a spool,</div>
<div class="p">Then as a river flows from its head-pool</div>
<div class="p">And purls, a windy fabric flowing thence</div>
<div class="p">Don as their mantle, Nature in suspense.</div>
<div class="p">The storm cloud breaks, the dark rides overhead,</div>
<div class="p">With whipping winds, with thunder roaring, dead</div>
<div class="p">Trees crashing with the glow of lightning swift,</div>
<div class="p">And Heaven's echo thus damped with a rift.</div>
<div class="p">Then lightning flames, shows figures from behind,
<div class="p">With moody robes, surrounded by their kind.
<div class="p">They rise in awful dignity and draw</div>
<div class="p">Their infantry commanding fear and awe,</div>
<div class="p">Move war machines, and batteries to thunder</div>
<div class="p">In awful state, and Earth and Heaven sunder,</div>
<div class="p">Then loose the Furies and loose man's great storm,</div>
<div class="p">To rival Nature in her grandest form,</div>
<div class="p">Even for a Pumpkin. Then, ye gods above,</div>
<div class="p">Bear witness! that they do it all for love.</div>
<div class="p">They'd hate to see an Orange Man destroy</div>
<div class="p">A City on a Hill where hoi polloi</div>
<div class="p">Defend more staunchly than the men of Troy.</div>
</div></div>
