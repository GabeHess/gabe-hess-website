I"ž<div class="p">I strode on high and rued the day</div>
<div class="p">When rue bestrode the heart of man,</div>
<div class="p">When people knew but one sole way</div>
<div class="p">And things well knew one Virtue's ban.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">A time there was when all and else</div>
<div class="p">Was more else less than bobbing ball,</div>
<div class="p">Which floats in ocean marking thus</div>
<div class="p">The floating mark, Tide's fickle wall.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Words issued forth: The time is now!</div>
<div class="p">And no Word matters at the time,</div>
<div class="p">But those which praise man's egoâ€”how?</div>
<div class="p">How well they man immortal grime.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Now Heaven has been shut to me </div>
<div class="p">I shut in Hell in Heaven roam,</div>
<div class="p">Until I find I'm missing He</div>
<div class="p">Who found the missing in the foam.</div>
