I"r#<div class="p">A horse-drawn buggy on the street</div>
<div class="p">No more could give a start;</div>
<div class="p">Nor shock of gray o'er sea-green eyes</div>
<div class="p">And leathern hide impart</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">A sense of strange antiquity,</div>
<div class="p">Though hat and necktie spoke</div>
<div class="p">To pin the creature to an age</div>
<div class="p">When fluster was a coke,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Than could this living relic shock</div>
<div class="p">With gauche uncertain mode</div>
<div class="p">That oddly seemed e'en fashion yet</div>
<div class="p">Was a past episode.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Young eyes he drew, but wanted none;</div>
<div class="p">With looks repulsing back</div>
<div class="p">Those peeping orbs molesting his</div>
<div class="p">Peace with their rude attack.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">For eyes that plumb such mysteries</div>
<div class="p">As no one ought to know,</div>
<div class="p">Although purgation bid them look</div>
<div class="p">On their reflexive foe,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Who, though impressive, yet defies</div>
<div class="p">Their sense of breeding quite,</div>
<div class="p">And less enthralls the eyes of youth</div>
<div class="p">Than innovation might;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Attend upon the wisdom lost</div>
<div class="p">And the teeth-cutting look</div>
<div class="p">That our aesthetes would reprehend,</div>
<div class="p">As an old-fashioned book;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He would have rather peer on such</div>
<div class="p">Diverting things as tend</div>
<div class="p">To their dishonor than to eye</div>
<div class="p">His visage condescend.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He hated them, they hated him,</div>
<div class="p">For cordiality</div>
<div class="p">Is rare between Antipodes</div>
<div class="p">Without nobility.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">And they were so ignoble he</div>
<div class="p">In a convulsion wrung</div>
<div class="p">A castigation most severe</div>
<div class="p">From his old-dart-tipped tongue.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He jeered at their confusion, he</div>
<div class="p">Disdained their ignorance</div>
<div class="p">And arrogance, and puffed his cheeks</div>
<div class="p">At their uncommon sense.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Then with the bluster of a gale,</div>
<div class="p">Bravado of a ship,</div>
<div class="p">And fine incisive quality</div>
<div class="p">Of a sea-master's quip,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He burst in declamation, with</div>
<div class="p">A nosegay of struck blows</div>
<div class="p">Presented with the courtesy</div>
<div class="p">That an admirer shows.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Ironic wit, sarcastic tones,</div>
<div class="p">And piquant fillips struck,</div>
<div class="p">With an unerring sense of right</div>
<div class="p">And proper, and with pluck.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The play was excellent, although</div>
<div class="p">They fled beneath the whip,</div>
<div class="p">Not being partial to the touch</div>
<div class="p">Of the snake-leather's tip.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Like buckshot scattered in the hide</div>
<div class="p">Of the embracing earth,</div>
<div class="p">They went a wispy hundred ways.</div>
<div class="p">So do streams at a firth.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The old man bid the spot, good day:</div>
<div class="p">Implacably a grouch,</div>
<div class="p">He stepped irately down the streets,</div>
<div class="p">And swore he would avouch</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">That kids are dumb, and streets are dull,</div>
<div class="p">And memories are fine;</div>
<div class="p">But how to bring the memory</div>
<div class="p">Into the present time?</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He pondered the affecting pith</div>
<div class="p">In late modernity</div>
<div class="p">Well-nestled; and bethought him how</div>
<div class="p">The present company</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Could he impress with urgent thought</div>
<div class="p">Of flowers that die apace,</div>
<div class="p">Which in their withered dotage show</div>
<div class="p">Ours is no simple case.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">For at that time, a party rose</div>
<div class="p">With eager pressing hand</div>
<div class="p">To cheer his countenance, although</div>
<div class="p">Their folly only fanned</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">His inclination to defy</div>
<div class="p">The folly of the age,</div>
<div class="p">On this occasion pressing like</div>
<div class="p">The public on a stage.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He feigned a disposition and</div>
<div class="p">Departed with a bow,</div>
<div class="p">Then gratefully amused his time</div>
<div class="p">With trifles and a vow</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To sneer with grace upon the day,</div>
<div class="p">But never to relent</div>
<div class="p">And scorning his perpetual</div>
<div class="p">Monotonous intent,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Adorn sophisticated halls,</div>
<div class="p">With cheap-show-trick displays,</div>
<div class="p">Such as shock, bore, repulse, annoy,</div>
<div class="p">With presence, all his days,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Without the guard of critical</div>
<div class="p">Sarcastic and bemused</div>
<div class="p">Decorum, as would fit a man</div>
<div class="p">Who graciously refused</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To give the time of day to clocks</div>
<div class="p">That melt upon a limb,</div>
<div class="p">And spur the mind to thought profound</div>
<div class="p">By melting on—a limb;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To read with awed sobriety</div>
<div class="p">The pieced together parts</div>
<div class="p">Of "poetry," with words that hang</div>
<div class="p">As evidence of art:</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Or sober in the present awe</div>
<div class="p">Of Williams' sublime</div>
<div class="p">Red wheelbarrow that makes one think</div>
<div class="p">There's something to a rhyme;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To ponder thought exalted and</div>
<div class="p">Great in profundity,</div>
<div class="p">Discovered by an atheist</div>
<div class="p">Who thought, essentially,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">That man's a cipher in a void,</div>
<div class="p">Sunk in a deeper deep</div>
<div class="p">Than man had known of theretofore,</div>
<div class="p">And, probably, asleep;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To ravel then unravel thought</div>
<div class="p">Upon a bookish reel:</div>
<div class="p">The author would be much amazed</div>
<div class="p">To see his tome reveal</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The gossip of a hundred years</div>
<div class="p">Past publication date,</div>
<div class="p">Ideas no one entertained</div>
<div class="p">Till certainly too late;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To chase a byway down a cliff,</div>
<div class="p">Insist it is a thought,</div>
<div class="p">A field of study, much revered</div>
<div class="p">By men and gravely taught;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To think within a shallow track,</div>
<div class="p">And crow o'er this small rut,</div>
<div class="p">Insisting his is a fine oak</div>
<div class="p">Which is a tiny nut;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To sordidly defy the past</div>
<div class="p">With a surpassingly</div>
<div class="p">Abundant, by historic bar,</div>
<div class="p">Share of stupidity;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">To bow, in short, before the sun</div>
<div class="p">Of an especial day,</div>
<div class="p">Ignoring universal light,</div>
<div class="p">A less fugacious ray.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He went his way, a shadow on</div>
<div class="p">The ancient body hung</div>
<div class="p">Of times past, when the air distilled</div>
<div class="p">A breath that made it young:</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">His was the body of the past,</div>
<div class="p">His was the shadow there</div>
<div class="p">That hung in memory of time</div>
<div class="p">Upon its corpse, a pair</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">That fascinated as it struck</div>
<div class="p">Blows such as send away,</div>
<div class="p">Attracting, warning, too confused</div>
<div class="p">To end unruly play.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He mumbled o'er his ancient parts</div>
<div class="p">Of wisdom, and defied</div>
<div class="p">The sounding tenor of the day</div>
<div class="p">With grumbled threats supplied.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The world upon him fondly looked—</div>
<div class="p">A melancholy sight,</div>
<div class="p">With leathern hide, and hair that turned</div>
<div class="p">A stricken ash-pile white,</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But still those sea-green eyes that spoke</div>
<div class="p">Of brilliant days that past</div>
<div class="p">In memory when time went not</div>
<div class="p">With such terrific haste</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">As treaded purple everything</div>
<div class="p">That barred the way to fore,</div>
<div class="p">The rushing, sudden, onward pace</div>
<div class="p">That he did so deplore.</div>
