I"Ê<div class="p">A sharp rock crag with cutting stroke</div>
<div class="p">The sky's throat slashed, and filled with bloodâ€”</div>
<div class="p">That seeped between the isles of cloudâ€”</div>
<div class="p">The sky's face in a savage flood.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The nimbus-shrouded eye, thus shawled,</div>
<div class="p">Espied reclining on a bed</div>
<div class="p">Of stained cloud-pillows and white mists</div>
<div class="p">That bloody fingers smeared with red,</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">With dullness, yet with brilliance,</div>
<div class="p">Twelve shafts of twinkling flame she shot,</div>
<div class="p">Till, dragging close, the knife-like crag</div>
<div class="p">Dragged too close, and her shawled neck caught.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then living pain shot from her eye,</div>
<div class="p">Which brightened with a thousand edge-</div>
<div class="p">Wise sharp incisive flaming shafts</div>
<div class="p">That her eye's shadows soon did fledge.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The cutthroat gloried in the wide</div>
<div class="p">Red carnage spreading through the height,</div>
<div class="p">And prayed the eye with bloodshot veins</div>
<div class="p">Would close and lose at last its sight.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The pale lid closed, the pale eye sunk,</div>
<div class="p">As the triumphant regicide</div>
<div class="p">Ascended to surmount the queen</div>
<div class="p">Who slowly withered, fell, and died.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The eye eclipsed, it sunk in flesh,</div>
<div class="p">Fast in the skull; with flesh and gore</div>
<div class="p">Across the vista amply strewn.</div>
<div class="p">The murderer then filled the score.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">She sunk, he rose, resplendently</div>
<div class="p">Accoutered in a blood-red robe.</div>
<div class="p">With purple and with many hues</div>
<div class="p">Magnificently robed he stood.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The knife-rock rose, in glory shone,</div>
<div class="p">With ghastly colors fairly crowned.</div>
<div class="p">But when in fits of death the queen</div>
<div class="p">Of all of Heaven sunk and drowned,</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The night as undertaker swept</div>
<div class="p">Through. Then the coronated king</div>
<div class="p">Who stood before in honor decked</div>
<div class="p">Was master of the evening:</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">An empty wilderness of stars,</div>
<div class="p">Like sycophants that clustered round</div>
<div class="p">A different, serene sweet lord,</div>
<div class="p">With pale, white luminescence crowned.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then, banishÃ¨d, he flew through the</div>
<div class="p">Dry empty regions of the night,</div>
<div class="p">Pursued by minions of the Moon</div>
<div class="p">Sent to arrest him in his flight.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">They found him face down, from the height</div>
<div class="p">Descended, lying near the base</div>
<div class="p">Of his tall throne; a sight forlorn,</div>
<div class="p">To see a monarch fall'n from grace.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">In concert for the broken king</div>
<div class="p">The sparking stars blazed overhead,</div>
<div class="p">A lovely lightning shroud for him</div>
<div class="p">Who lay upon the bare earth, dead.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then tender with the rosy dawn</div>
<div class="p">She softly o'er the lightening brink,</div>
<div class="p">Descrying her murderer in the dust,</div>
<div class="p">Did shyly rise on clouds of pink.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The mourning over for the king,</div>
<div class="p">The morning brought the fairest queen,</div>
<div class="p">Who gently thanked the pale night lord,</div>
<div class="p">As mourners scuttered off unseen.</div>
