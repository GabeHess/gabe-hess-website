<div class="p">Suffer yourself, O poet, to be taught,</div>
<div class="p">Lay tactful and religious on the page</div>
<div class="p">True judgment of the reverential age</div>
<div class="p">That had its day 'fore this unholy time,</div>

<div class="p">Strewn all along the corridor of mists,</div>
<div class="p">The Road to Rome is paved with Methodists.</div>
<div class="p">Twin pits of error lay beside the path,</div>
<div class="p">Whose dupes enjoy alike God's holy wrath.</div>
<div class="p">But down Byzantium's wretched winding ways,</div>
<div class="p">The vehicle of other error strays:</div>
<div class="p">They hate the Pope, and might to Rome belong,</div>
<div class="p">But they (farewell, my promise) hate him wrong!</div>
