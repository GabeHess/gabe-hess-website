<div class="p">I fell asleep and dreamt of lasting darkness</div>
<div class="p">And the unexampled horror of an age</div>
<div class="p">Of universal ignorance, green-parkless,</div>
<div class="p">For a demon chained, the confines of a cage;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Where ghastly howlings smote the midnight air</div>
<div class="p">And ghouls were teething on immortal chains;</div>
<div class="p">Where poverty and death were everywhere,</div>
<div class="p">A fasting race writhed in its mortal pains.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">There comfort and conveniences had not</div>
<div class="p">Redeemed the stricken earth—the earth was scorched,</div>
<div class="p">The air was rank, and human breath was hot,</div>
<div class="p">As were all love and kindness by it torched.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But there beside I saw the mother's hand;</div>
<div class="p">And out of superstition shone a light;</div>
<div class="p">Cathedrals rose to soar above the land;</div>
<div class="p">And soldiers fought as brothers oft do fight.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The bravest soldier fought and lived in war;</div>
<div class="p">No senseless bullet knocked him to the ground;</div>
<div class="p">And virtue told in ancient village lore</div>
<div class="p">Was seen in heroes honored and renowned.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Primeval elements and impulse ran</div>
<div class="p">And blackest evil ran in currents strong:</div>
<div class="p">If night was darker, day more bright began</div>
<div class="p">And good and right were suns that swallowed wrong.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Then I awoke and found it was a dream;</div>
<div class="p">I rose and to my window went to look;</div>
<div class="p">I looked, and then the trivial world did seem</div>
<div class="p">A luxury better to be left than took.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">I almost thought I did prefer the world</div>
<div class="p">Of poverty and ignorance and death,</div>
<div class="p">Where Satan by the angels had been hurled</div>
<div class="p">But still one felt the warmth of human breath.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But I discovered to my very joy</div>
<div class="p">That evil was a subtle, lurking force,</div>
<div class="p">And powers still the old lines did employ</div>
<div class="p">And good and evil ’gainst each other course.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Virtue was more needed there than elsewhere</div>
<div class="p">And courage was the edict of the time.</div>
<div class="p">Strength and justice were illicit trade: there</div>
<div class="p">Was never a more salutary crime.</div>
