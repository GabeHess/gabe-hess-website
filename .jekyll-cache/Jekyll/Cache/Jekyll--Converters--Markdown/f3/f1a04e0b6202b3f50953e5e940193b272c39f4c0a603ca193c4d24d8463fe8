I"„<div class="p">In contemplation of virtue and contravention of vice</div>
<div class="p">He upheld the creed and curfew as he burned Florentine ice,</div>
<div class="p">Leaving pocked across the surface of the remaining frost</div>
<div class="p">The souls of those who wandered and unfound were duly lost:</div>
<div class="p">But girdling the edges he left no vacant plot</div>
<div class="p">Where from fire and ruin could freeze the neighbors of Lot.</div>
<div class="p">For having melted awkward sin from birth</div>
<div class="p">And struck all manifested sin from earth,</div>
<div class="p">No more it seemed imperative to keep</div>
<div class="p">The souls of sinners in the marble deep.</div>
<div class="p">The superannuation of sinners with sin</div>
<div class="p">Made the second, the third, a paradise to win.</div>
<div class="p">He gloried in his boiling pitch, he poured it â€™pon the snow,</div>
<div class="p">Which melting he directed, rushing on each several foe</div>
<div class="p">Who thought or who supposed the circumstance of sin or vice</div>
<div class="p">Could necessitate virtue or could make men aught but nice.</div>
