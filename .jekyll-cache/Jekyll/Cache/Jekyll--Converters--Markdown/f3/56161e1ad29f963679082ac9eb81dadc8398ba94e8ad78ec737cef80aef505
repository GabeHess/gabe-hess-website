I"ƒ<div class="p">Look! some child with a pin has holes in the welkin made,</div>
<div class="p">Has pricked a portal there, and there, to the blanket of fire</div>
<div class="p">Which wraps all being twice round, as a sacrifice all ablaze;</div>
<div class="p">Nay, but sacrifice was made: It rose in a glorious blaze</div>
<div class="p">Upward, rising to the throne; now men toward its feet aspireâ€”</div>
<div class="p">The throne's blaze casts fire to the cinders wherethrough I wade.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Lights, in the sky, stippled on the night blackboard, amaze</div>
<div class="p">My wits: they are thrown senseless but for sense upon the pyre</div>
<div class="p">Of an army burning now twice, in heaven now not to fade.</div>
<div class="p">Stars, disappearing sparks in the blaze of the general fire,</div>
<div class="p">Alone people creation, like to when newly made.</div>
