I"t<div class="p">I caught a fleeting glimpse of love:</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She dwelt beside my pen;</div>
<div class="p">There as I struck the riddling page</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And struck and smote again</div>
<div class="p">And dashed proud feature to the ground,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dark'ning page, as night,</div>
<div class="p">Accepted of her lilting touch</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then saw her margins white.</div>
<div class="p">With fear she blanched and took no more</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of inky dark aflow;</div>
<div class="p">Her face in terror looked as one</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who’d rather not than know</div>
<div class="p">But now at last had found the fate</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That e’er attends the play</div>
<div class="p">Performed by actors fooling men:</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Lord perceives their way.</div>
<div class="p">For she as I had known the sight</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of poem and of song,</div>
<div class="p">Of sonnet fair in Playwright’s hand,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Night spent unweaving wrong,</div>
<div class="p">The suitors round the fated hall</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Too late they lost their nerve)—</div>
<div class="p">All yet had fixed their gaze on love</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whom they’d die to serve.</div>
<div class="p">I dropped my tool of writing then</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cupped my hands in prayer:</div>
<div class="p">I thought to capture love—alas!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For hands met empty air;</div>
<div class="p">And perching on my shattered soul</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love sweetly queried how</div>
<div class="p">My name I thought so very high</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With ease so humble now.</div>
<div class="p">I answered not but showed no art;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She tittered, and with skill</div>
<div class="p">She stirred her feathers and alit</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Again on iv’ry sill—</div>
<div class="p">That feeling place of love’s repose,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of pain beneath the drum,</div>
<div class="p">Of lambent touch and sweetened song</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed was going numb.</div>
<div class="p">And from that place the illness crept;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The part subdued the whole;</div>
<div class="p">The pen that dropped from deadened hand</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Felt Newton’s hopeless pull:</div>
<div class="p">It knew—alas!—no hope could be</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (It held no hope as dear),</div>
<div class="p">For though I loved in metaphor</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love never stayed to hear.</div>
