I"H<div class="p">The sweet complexion of a tune</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of lilting lust for stars</div>
<div class="p">Broke forth from yonder instrument</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of soon pacific Mars.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">It wrought its witchcraft in my ear,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would soon command a thrall,</div>
<div class="p">But for my high-spent tendency</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vain to eschew its call.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Sung to perfection yet received</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With grace of Cyclopes land,</div>
<div class="p">The ballad soon had skirt the front</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As smuggled contraband.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The guard alert to unseen threats,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With orders to defy</div>
<div class="p">Apollo's sweet ambassadors,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well kept sea, earth, and sky.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But music, Ithacan in craft,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had greater stores of skill</div>
<div class="p">Than were supposed by sandaled men</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who wrought their master's will.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">With subtle ’sinuations and</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A penchant for disguise,</div>
<div class="p">Harmonic strains sought slinking to</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Transgress the lord's surmise.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">They well perceived the mortal ilk</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sentry at the gate</div>
<div class="p">And thus supposed the likewise lot</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protected by his plate.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">They slunk with visage not their own</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tinkled from abreast,</div>
<div class="p">Then silent on the windward side</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They crept upon the West.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But wind and sun betrayed their cause,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And howling of a sort</div>
<div class="p">Unallied to their artifice</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave sentinels report.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The skirmish brief, for so it was,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ill boded glad encore,</div>
<div class="p">But undismayed by swift defeat</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They'd fain prolong the war.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">They joined their numbers and beset</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In bold forefront attack</div>
<div class="p">The unamusèd standing post</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But soon were fluttered back.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Perceiving then their want of wit,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They'd rally and retire;</div>
<div class="p">Confused by custom they'd ignite</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An uncompanioned pyre.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Now weary of vain excellence</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They'd still once more divide</div>
<div class="p">And as is sagely often urged</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Take nature as their guide.'</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">A windrowed lot they did appear,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in disorder great;</div>
<div class="p">An army of the colonies,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marked by colonial fate.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Ensconced in stone the monolith</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose pride they did besiege</div>
<div class="p">In irritation called his men</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bounce light off their liege.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Left to the whim of happenstance</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A state bestrode the verge,</div>
<div class="p">And untold days withdrew to think</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which glory would emerge.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The fading tunes perceived a mark,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set with complacent pride,</div>
<div class="p">Which might convey their noble wish</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To in more space abide.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">As Proteus they varied form</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And flitted in the guise</div>
<div class="p">Of full-grown creepers ’late become</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prismatic butterflies.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">They then with involutions mocked</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The temper of the guard:</div>
<div class="p">His quietude could ill endure</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When struck by flying nard.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Thus flitting and thus flaming round,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A dome of whirling light,</div>
<div class="p">They danced awhirl, in bright array,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And charmed him with their flight.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Then slumber overtook the man;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But armor held his chest:</div>
<div class="p">The kindly tunes undid the strap</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To simplify his rest.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Then spreading substance through the halls</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And alleys of the town,</div>
<div class="p">They garbed the streets, the drear streets with</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A flow’ry, flowing gown.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">And dancing, scintillating for</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unreceptive throng,</div>
<div class="p">They wrought upon each present soul</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wonderment of song.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Then leaving the unmeasured host—</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sought a conquest still—</div>
<div class="p">They wove their colors round the lord,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His head with song to fill.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Though stony in the first approach,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of melody a-wing,</div>
<div class="p">He saw the circling tapestry</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And soon began to sing.</div>
