I"À<div class="p">I thought upon the lonesome morrow</div>
<div class="p">Shrouded in the suit of grey,</div>
<div class="p">Of solemn grieving, cheerless sorrow</div>
<div class="p">Or bells a-ringing, children gay.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">To think that on that day I'll know</div>
<div class="p">The lot my life has tended toward!</div>
<div class="p">Will sin observe eternal woe,</div>
<div class="p">Or virtue claim its just reward?</div>
