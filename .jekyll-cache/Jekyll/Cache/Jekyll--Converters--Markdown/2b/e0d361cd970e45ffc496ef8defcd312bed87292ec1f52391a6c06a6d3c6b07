<div class="p">Piped through the teeth by a capacious lung;</div>
<div class="p">Proclaim expansions of the public heart,</div>
<div class="p">A swollen conscience punctured by the dart</div>
<div class="p">Fine-tipped of your sincere grandiloquence;</div>
<div class="p">Send needles marching in fine militance</div>
<div class="p">Through atmospheres to pierce upon a touch</div>
<div class="p">The public conscience swollen overmuch,</div>
<div class="p">Which then should burst and melt away in tears</div>
<div class="p">To wash away the mischief of the years.â€”</div>
<div class="p">O mighty pulpit! and O mighty pen!</div>
<div class="p">The instruments of a profusive ken,</div>
<div class="p">Expanding to afflict unfair conditions</div>
<div class="p">With millstone, grindstone, and great impositions.â€”</div>
<div class="p">By wanton speech engage to disallow</div>
<div class="p">Who worships not the legislature's cow,</div>
<div class="p">That bloviating beast of tail and horn</div>
<div class="p">That bellows for an other nature's morn,</div>
<div class="p">That fine-adornÃ¨d beast bedecked in hues</div>
<div class="p">Of pink, of white, that eager for the cues</div>
<div class="p">Of academic red and for the calls</div>
<div class="p">Of matadors, of Eagleton, of Rawls,</div>
<div class="p">Each bidding for attentions of the bull,</div>
<div class="p">Begins to romp in circles none control.</div>
<div class="p">Those undeclarÃ¨d; graded, meta-graded,</div>
<div class="p">Or thrice ineptly double-meta-graded</div>
<div class="p">Upon the scale of scalar imperfection;</div>
<div class="p">Or those possessed of too pale a complexion;</div>
<div class="p">Those ill-possessed of adjectival tact,</div>
<div class="p">Of noun, or pronoun, verb in the abstract;</div>
<div class="p">Will pass before the flagellating tail</div>
<div class="p">Of Master Kine, upraiser of the taille.</div>
<div class="p">Whatâ€”would they part their lips or ope'</div>
<div class="p">A cavern for executors of soap?</div>
<div class="p">How could bethink they to advance a pip</div>
<div class="p">From the asylum of their upper lip,</div>
<div class="p">When all the while to revoke their say,</div>
<div class="p">All that they'd gamble on a verbal play,</div>
<div class="p">Was the ambition of the moral class,</div>
<div class="p">In interests of the unambitious mass?</div>
<div class="p">No word not vetted, no abuse of style</div>
<div class="p">Should pass bureaucracies or the turnstile</div>
<div class="p">Of agencies committed to the cause</div>
<div class="p">Of garnering intelligent applause.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dare to suggest that symptoms oft result</div>
<div class="p">From causes and professional revolt</div>
<div class="p">Will blight you with effectsâ€”to meet your due,</div>
<div class="p">On earth establish the kingdom of rue.</div>
<div class="p">Then to establish guidelines for the pen,</div>
<div class="p">The high, anointed, the Ãœbermenschen</div>
<div class="p">Will lead the raceâ€”men perfect to the one:</div>
<div class="p">A rare event!â€”to profit by the Sun,</div>
<div class="p">Which 'lumines the pale visage of the page</div>
<div class="p">To show thereon the incense of the age;</div>
<div class="p">Make capital from the triumphant creed</div>
<div class="p">That champions its childrenâ€”men in need.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now words I pledge to censors of the time</div>
<div class="p">Whose heart-sap trickles in unmetered rhyme,</div>
<div class="p">Or unrhymed meter, or restricted verse,</div>
<div class="p">Verse strictured to a preordainÃ¨d curse</div>
<div class="p">That balances abuse on targets of</div>
<div class="p">The <em>negative</em> delineating love.</div>
<div class="p">Take words engendered for expression by</div>
<div class="p">A warrior race, enunciating 'fie!'</div>
<div class="p">And 'fie!' againâ€”Defy again</div>
<div class="p">The hateful words of the apostate pen</div>
<div class="p">Committing treason 'gainst humanity</div>
<div class="p">By analyzing post-modernity.</div>
<div class="p">All other words forbid or redefine</div>
<div class="p">To better match the temper of the time;</div>
<div class="p">The definition change of 'liberty,'</div>
<div class="p">'That man may better force man to be free';</div>
<div class="p">For he whose metric is a width of hair</div>
<div class="p">Imperfect, let us redefine 'to dare.'</div>
<div class="p">For want of order in the lexicon</div>
<div class="p">Let language a new robe of meaning don.</div>
<div class="p">Let all proponents of the dictionare</div>
<div class="p">Appear but dogmatists or doctrinaire</div>
<div class="p">Reactionaries longing for an age</div>
<div class="p">Of dinosaurs dissembling to be sage.</div>
<div class="p">Let each antagonist with old semantics</div>
<div class="p">Be caught in erudition and pedantics;</div>
<div class="p">For they have reason and tradition's trust</div>
<div class="p">But we have lately redefined what's 'just.'</div>
<div class="p">The dictionary is a book to moldâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Or 'of'â€”for old it is, how very old!</div>
<div class="p">The dictionaryâ€”what a comic jestâ€”</div>
<div class="p">The dictionary fails the modern test:</div>
<div class="p">For how think we to order words therein</div>
<div class="p">Without repugnant principles wherein</div>
<div class="p">Some letters would have undue primacy</div>
<div class="p">And all would trample on the rights of 'Z'?</div>
<div class="p">How to achieve some letterly precision,</div>
<div class="p">Or even find a context for 'derision'?</div>
<div class="p">All humor, flee! all nomenclature, out!</div>
<div class="p">Before this lexico-politic rout.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What fine improvements sanctioned by a force</div>
<div class="p">Of army clerics that can but endorse</div>
<div class="p">Systemic lunacy with novel words,</div>
<div class="p">With paeans to the Yalies and the Kurds.</div>
<div class="p">What fine improvements to the public rule,</div>
<div class="p">Now children learn the alphabet in school</div>
<div class="p">By a new orthographic principle</div>
<div class="p">If not alarming all but risible.</div>
<div class="p">What fine improvements to the song of life,</div>
<div class="p">Now man may have a spectrum for a wife!</div>
<div class="p">What fine improvements of what varied sorts,</div>
<div class="p">Now justice is the frontage of the courts.</div>
<div class="p">I stray not from my aim when I began,</div>
<div class="p">For all words fall within this essay's plan,</div>
<div class="p">Since all words are defined and can undone</div>
<div class="p">Be by the children of the rising Sun.</div>
