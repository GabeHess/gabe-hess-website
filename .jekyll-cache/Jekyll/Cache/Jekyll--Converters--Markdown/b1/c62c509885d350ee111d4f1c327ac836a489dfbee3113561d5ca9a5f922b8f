I"#<div class="p">An ugly rabble whines upon the street</div>
<div class="p">With cardboard emblems of their plangent want,</div>
<div class="p">Their self and image o'er their tramping feet</div>
<div class="p">Suspended, with windpipes possessed of cant,</div>
<div class="p">And bay they truth and beauty with their chant,</div>
<div class="p">Their steps blast roads o'er-paved with wind-flung trash:</div>
<div class="p">'Twere munching shellfish down the wide Levant,</div>
<div class="p">Tossing cracked shells into the Southern gash.</div>
<div class="p">Down Pennsylvania Ave., insulting, brash,</div>
<div class="p">They strut among the enduring souvenirs</div>
<div class="p">Of lordly history. Nothing might abash</div>
<div class="p">Their fierce encounter with the piteous years.</div>
<div class="p">Well might one's hands clench for their odious sneers.</div>
<div class="p">Bright color patches melt into a fog</div>
<div class="p">Of hues absorbed. What might not pamphleteers</div>
<div class="p">Do who so filled with turbid mud a bog?</div>
