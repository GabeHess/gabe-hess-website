I"W<div class="p">The sickly unconcern for aught that would confine,</div>
<div class="p">The ease wherewith the tongue tastes Dionysian wine,</div>
<div class="p">Decoctions varied of the very cheapest brew,</div>
<div class="p">Rid melancholy and the weakest dock or rue</div>
<div class="p">From portico, red brick, concrete, and Gothic spires,</div>
<div class="p">The dwelling place of Chomsky, where big Faust retires.</div>
<div class="p">To be thus girdled by no fear of surplus care,</div>
<div class="p">To duck beneath the swinging branch of aught to bear,</div>
<div class="p">Perhaps would bait the drudge or jack of idle sport,</div>
<div class="p">Whose life consists of awkward jest and swift retort:</div>
<div class="p">But still this dull repose and catatonic mirth</div>
<div class="p">Uncleft by sweet variety would seem a dearth.</div>
