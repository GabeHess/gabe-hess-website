I"<div class="p">"No need," said I, "My poetry suffices</div>
<div class="p">For all my destitution, any want,</div>
<div class="p">Rough worry chafing at occasional crises,</div>
<div class="p">Or existential, so laconic taunt":</div>
<div class="p">Not, not to say pretentious or avant</div>
<div class="p">Was my ambition, rather tweedy stuff</div>
<div class="p">The utmost was of everything I'd vaunt</div>
<div class="p">Or fling in face of day, and boast, "enough."</div>
<div class="p">The pen has quickened, with the timely snuff</div>
<div class="p">Of inspiration, take and read a poem</div>
<div class="p">Of generation dead, and with voice gruff</div>
<div class="p">Spurn overtures of denizens of home.</div>
<div class="p">The sonnet pales unto a sapless chrome,</div>
<div class="p">And reading seems less pleasurable sport,</div>
<div class="p">I take my pen, which rudderless let roam,</div>
<div class="p">And grind it page-ward in despair's resort;</div>
<div class="p">But wring no words from literary court</div>
<div class="p">Where pompous figures, splendid dukes and kings,</div>
<div class="p">Fair queens and duchesses mix and consort,</div>
<div class="p">Court jester with a warbling music sings.</div>
<div class="p">I cast from word to word, Romantic springs,</div>
<div class="p">Augustan order, then mine orphaned own,</div>
<div class="p">And grant none please, nor poesy's blasted wings,</div>
<div class="p">So rather greet the greater joys I've known</div>
<div class="p">With due response and joy in kindred bone.</div>
