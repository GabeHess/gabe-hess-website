I"	<div class="p">I cast about, and "never thus," I said:</div>
<div class="p">"The world in its arrangement as things stand</div>
<div class="p">Was wrought by one mere clever child; instead</div>
<div class="p">Bless me with the make of a wiser hand."</div>
<div class="p">Then quoth He: "Child, My first world is above,</div>
<div class="p">Where angels gaze My face upon, nor cease,</div>
<div class="p">But move according to the law of love,</div>
<div class="p">And prosper 'neath the wing of tuneful peace.</div>
<div class="p">The world below is proof, nor perfect thus."</div>
<div class="p">I steeled myself to the hard grit in store,</div>
<div class="p">My spirit wandered back to what discuss</div>
<div class="p">My round-me fellows, girding strife I deplore.</div>
