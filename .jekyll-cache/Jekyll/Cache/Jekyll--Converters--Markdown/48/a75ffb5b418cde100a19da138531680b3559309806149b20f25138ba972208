I"´4<p>â€” â€” â€”</p>

<p>In my satirical imitations of contemporary â€˜traditionalâ€™ poetry toward the end, I have attempted to capture the baldness and emptiness of modern poetry. The literal reality consists of empty images, lifeless form, and a general sense of irrelevance humanistically speaking. However, in aiming to capture the spirit, I fear I have gone too far, and produced poetry which bears little resemblance to the original.</p>

<p>â€” â€” â€”</p>

<div class="p">You keep our heritage of words and rhymes</div>
<div class="p">And so keep out the spirit of the times.</div>
<div class="p">One little chamber you would fain preserve</div>
<div class="p">Against those who material gods do serve.</div>
<div class="p">You careful stewards of th' immortal age</div>
<div class="p">Retire with your treasures in a cage</div>
<div class="p">Of cast aluminum, steel, and concrete,</div>
<div class="p">A cloister and a tomb for metric feet.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You scribble your own lines in flowing verse,</div>
<div class="p">A lyrical escort for poesy's hearse.</div>
<div class="p">But as you write, lo, through the open door</div>
<div class="p">The modern spirit slides, along the floor</div>
<div class="p">With careful step she glides, then drawing near</div>
<div class="p">Cocks to expected words a complex ear.</div>
<div class="p">But no words come (for who would read aloud</div>
<div class="p">New Literary Verse: who'd lift a shroud?).</div>
<div class="p">You scribble madly, and she closer draws,</div>
<div class="p">A lab's dry-ice block thaws, a raven caws.</div>
<div class="p">She stands behind your shoulder, looking down,</div>
<div class="p">To read your verse with an approving frown.</div>
<div class="p">(For in the age of poetry paroxysmal,</div>
<div class="p">Is not expression paradoxical?)</div>
<div class="p">You startâ€”Who, What?â€”and rush to bolt the door,</div>
<div class="p">While she you bolt out pencils an encore.</div>
<div class="p">She finishes the sleek, industrial, strange</div>
<div class="p">Pre-fabricated leer, the lettered mange;</div>
<div class="p">Emotion weak, or measured drops, or drought;</div>
<div class="p">A Freudian dream, or cold, uncanny shout.</div>
<div class="p">There sounds a knock: you open to a fool</div>
<div class="p">And box him soundly for a breach of rule.</div>
<div class="p">Then to your poesy you return and write:</div>
<div class="p">What lazy inspirations come at night!</div>
<div class="p">A fainting flourish and the lines are done</div>
<div class="p">(If lines you call these formless words that run).</div>
<div class="p">The latest poem with Godspeed is sent</div>
<div class="p">To publishers as 'Orisons of Lent.'</div>
<div class="p">(But haste and words are poison to intent.</div>
<div class="p">Therefore, these characters to introduce</div>
<div class="p">I haste, and neither they traduce.)</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are, they sayâ€”O rambling am Iâ€”</div>
<div class="p">The keepers of the dusk and morning sky.</div>
<div class="p">Take verse, for instance: you the verse of old</div>
<div class="p">Do count and keep, like precious leaf of gold.</div>
<div class="p">Thus Shakespeare, Milton, Dante, older:</div>
<div class="p">Chaucer: Virgil, Sophocles and Homerâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Retire in their dotage to your care</div>
<div class="p">And you their genius keep in good repair.</div>
<div class="p">And later mint you keep: thus goodman Frost,</div>
<div class="p">A penny rubbed to shining; 'We are lost,'</div>
<div class="p">The mutterings of a morbidâ€”who is he</div>
<div class="p">But euro Eliot swallowing the sea?</div>
<div class="p">And Hopkins, an ornate and antique piece,</div>
<div class="p">And Dickinson, a buried coin at leastâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Your stewardship maintains. Yet something odd</div>
<div class="p">Strikes like a glancing blow or metal rod.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The whole of your collected poetry</div>
<div class="p">Is like a coin that shines, but variously</div>
<div class="p">Is rusted and the shine cannot atone</div>
<div class="p">For rust when rust has spread its mottle roan.</div>
<div class="p">And so the whole abides: in great disorder,</div>
<div class="p">Almost a poem that some modern tortured.</div>
<div class="p">Your poetry recalls the modern Louvre:</div>
<div class="p">A pyramid there does not its place behoove.</div>
<div class="p">So you, as long as poetry is old,</div>
<div class="p">Can ably judge if made of lead or gold.</div>
<div class="p">But if a chemist carries on the ruse,</div>
<div class="p">You cannot tell the Devil from the Muse.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take Eliot and the modern school of verse,</div>
<div class="p">Those limpid fellows on the ages' hearse.</div>
<div class="p">For if we spread out Thomas with his fable,</div>
<div class="p">Like patients etherized upon a table,</div>
<div class="p">We find his poetry, in puzzled form,</div>
<div class="p">Comparing to a halfway strangled worm.</div>
<div class="p">He has stored up the spirit of the greats</div>
<div class="p">(And tested the injunction of the Fates),</div>
<div class="p">And ta'en his store of images and phrase,</div>
<div class="p">A liquid sea of starsâ€”but do not gazeâ€”</div>
<div class="p">And metaphors and half-digested scraps</div>
<div class="p">Of literary ham, and Von de Trapps,</div>
<div class="p">And legion aging men, each very bored,</div>
<div class="p">And ta'en this storming, bitter sea and poured</div>
<div class="p">It on the balding head of grotesque life.</div>
<div class="p">He's stabbed emotion with a murderer's knife,</div>
<div class="p">And wrought instead an intellectual numbness,</div>
<div class="p">And strangled reason, but I do digress,</div>
<div class="p">And has proclaimed a morbid triumph o'er</div>
<div class="p">The age by being modern to the core.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How do you, I must ask, profess to like</div>
<div class="p">This Thomas Stearns? I'd sooner vote for Ike!</div>
<div class="p">Somehow you reconcile Pope with Pound:</div>
<div class="p">I'll not insist the air is not the ground!</div>
<div class="p">Somehow you reconcile Pound with Pope,</div>
<div class="p">And trade a fountain for a bar of soap.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your rule and measure, seldom known to err,</div>
<div class="p">Do shrink and grow, in the polluted air</div>
<div class="p">Of culture in the modern worldâ€”alas,</div>
<div class="p">Your compass and your magnifying glass</div>
<div class="p">Do spin and burn, before so clear and true.</div>
<div class="p">But you return to ages not so new,</div>
<div class="p">And lo! your compass, rule, and glass align.</div>
<div class="p">You speak a judgment fluent and condign.</div>
<div class="p">Then when you have upheld Parnassus' peak</div>
<div class="p">You turn andâ€”horrors!â€”your <em>own</em> voice do seek.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You aim your pen in every wrong direction</div>
<div class="p">And paint your face with too green a complexion.</div>
<div class="p">Affected sickliness, how long, how long</div>
<div class="p">Be thou the mask of literary wrong?</div>
<div class="p">You think, it seems, that greatness is a bore</div>
<div class="p">Dressed in a humanistic mask obscure.</div>
<div class="p">You mourn creative with your plastic flowers,</div>
<div class="p">But dare you not address the higher powers.</div>
<div class="p">'O Herbert'â€”thus a literary groan</div>
<div class="p">Precedes, then prostrate at the Muses' throne</div>
<div class="p">You numb your grief with cultural sedatives,</div>
<div class="p">You numb, and call yourselves 'conservatives.'</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You do not often imitate the man</div>
<div class="p">Whose flame you keep and who the flame began</div>
<div class="p">Of poetry that languishes in state</div>
<div class="p">And carries out the West's exhausted fate.</div>
<div class="p">You have no principled objection to</div>
<div class="p">Free verse, although you generally do</div>
<div class="p">Not use itâ€”for yourselves, you do prefer</div>
<div class="p">The tried and true old meter of meter.</div>
<div class="p">And though you sprinkle with morbidities</div>
<div class="p">Your poems, you prefer orthodoxies.</div>
<div class="p">Each reference blunt to the late modern age</div>
<div class="p">That blotches the complexion of the page</div>
<div class="p">Does not offend, for who'd besiege a mole</div>
<div class="p">When mountains stand by with an ugly troll?</div>
<div class="p">A thousand idioms I could excuse</div>
<div class="p">And technicalities forgive the Muse.</div>
<div class="p">An 'ectoplasm' I should let abide</div>
<div class="p">And 'liquid crystal' I would never hide.</div>
<div class="p">I do not question the antiquity</div>
<div class="p">Of sentiment or phrase or imagery,</div>
<div class="p">Though lacking footnotes that old age commend</div>
<div class="p">And tie your poem to the ages' hem.</div>
<div class="p">Who would suppose your poems sinful or</div>
<div class="p">Unorthodoxâ€”not I! 'tis something moreâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Your poems, Christian, are a dreadful bore!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your subjects, they are orthodox but dull,</div>
<div class="p">And bounce like peanuts off a hardened skull.</div>
<div class="p">The mysteries of ages you do drag</div>
<div class="p">Into the day, and publish in a rag.</div>
<div class="p">Your style is to punctuate and fill</div>
<div class="p">The gaps with balding sentences that kill</div>
<div class="p">Poetic sensibility in their</div>
<div class="p">Surpassing blandness that young poets deter</div>
<div class="p">From writing poesy, for this drudgery</div>
<div class="p">Is better paid in writing history.</div>
<div class="p">Your verse summed up is 'Bible verse in bald'</div>
<div class="p">And reference to all that's haply auld.</div>
<div class="p">You versify? You prosify your verse!</div>
<div class="p">You think of marriage when you see a hearse!</div>
<div class="p">But then you write a treatise on the name</div>
<div class="p">Of Lord Almighty and secure your fame.</div>
<div class="p">You document the processes by which</div>
<div class="p">Old Caravaggio our souls bewitched.</div>
<div class="p">In short, you play on the traditional tropes</div>
<div class="p">And nothing need but knowledge of the ropes.</div>
<div class="p">If Eliot wrote transcendent ugliness,</div>
<div class="p">And legions rose to come to his defense,</div>
<div class="p">Now you transcendence have forsook together</div>
<div class="p">And turned to documenting change of weather.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When poetry is prose and prose is bad,</div>
<div class="p">One longs to hear the poet turning mad.</div>
<div class="p">When Broadway musicals more court the Muse</div>
<div class="p">Than Christian poets who her help refuse,</div>
<div class="p">One wishes that rebellion would commence</div>
<div class="p">And music once more borrow aid from sense.</div>
<div class="p">But beauty has become subservient</div>
<div class="p">To the correctness of our sentiment.</div>
<div class="p">Your verse gives out a feeble, flickering lightâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Sad solace if your sentiments are right!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The true, the good, the beautiful,' you write,</div>
<div class="p">'Are three yet one. Just like the godhead.'</div>
<div class="p">But no, I pray, let's do begin again,</div>
<div class="p">And blunt another topic on our pen.</div>
<div class="p">'I walked into a parish church because</div>
<div class="p">I thought it was Sunday. It was only Saturday.</div>
<div class="p">I was all dressed up. When I saw her</div>
<div class="p">Kneeling in a pew I thought she was dead,</div>
<div class="p">But she was only praying. So I knelt too</div>
<div class="p">And prayed beside her. For a moment</div>
<div class="p">I thought she might cry. But then</div>
<div class="p">She stood up. We rose together.</div>
<div class="p">We started to sing but stopped and we'â€”</div>
<div class="p">Made mockery of infinity.</div>
<div class="p">'When the god-man comes to judge</div>
<div class="p">He'll bind the chaff. O Lord, am I chaff?</div>
<div class="p">I wonder. And when I tire of wondering</div>
<div class="p">I cry.' Or: 'When I was a child</div>
<div class="p">I loved Doubting Thomas by Caravaggio.</div>
<div class="p">I peered at his wrinkles</div>
<div class="p">And thought his physiognomy was mine.'</div>
<div class="p">And so, and so, and so, and so, and tripping on and on</div>
<div class="p">We blithely dull the intellect while boring everyone.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll not believe that poetry is dead,</div>
<div class="p">For when verse dies, the Christian age is dead,</div>
<div class="p">And all's exhausted, and the modern age</div>
<div class="p">Has naught but tragic Eliot on the page.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That poem that was packaged up and sent</div>
<div class="p">To publishers as 'Orisons of Lent'</div>
<div class="p">Was published and enjoyed a good report</div>
<div class="p">When read by every literary sort.</div>
