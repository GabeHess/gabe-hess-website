I"ý<div class="p">The mighty hands of Moloch to devour</div>
<div class="p">The infant placed in their predacious cup</div>
<div class="p">Raised to propitiate the Great Bull's power</div>
<div class="p">The crying, helpless sacrifice up, up:</div>
<div class="p">The Bull's mouth gaped to on the infant sup,</div>
<div class="p">Which fell into consuming flames and burnt</div>
<div class="p">With ghastly pleasure as when a small pup</div>
<div class="p">Is drowned in local country river's current.</div>
<div class="p">The maw of fire thus cradled flesh, blood arrant,</div>
<div class="p">Whose screams of horror flute and tambourine,</div>
<div class="p">Screaming mother's voice, her chosen male parent,</div>
<div class="p">And harlot sister suckled in rage wean</div>
<div class="p">Of force to chill blood at the deft machine's</div>
<div class="p">Slaughter of innocence. The Bull's great head,</div>
<div class="p">Grew, greater grew; the lurid women's keens</div>
<div class="p">Grew louder, louder, till the Beast was fed.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">A rabble of enlightened worshipers,</div>
<div class="p">A sea of algae, with green misty shrouds</div>
<div class="p">That celebrate dead faces with green smears,</div>
<div class="p">With ears bestrewed, with ugliness endowedâ€”</div>
<div class="p">A hideous sight, a horrid, horrid crowd,</div>
<div class="p">A celebration of the death of beauty;</div>
<div class="p">They all are silent, till they all are loud,</div>
<div class="p">In festival for the decease of duty;</div>
<div class="p">Infected with the virus of vile Cuties,</div>
<div class="p">For this emancipation from belief,</div>
<div class="p">They are a far cry from the tutti frutti</div>
<div class="p">Expected, as they raven o'er their beef.</div>
<div class="p">All in the green of over-verdant leaf,</div>
<div class="p">They smear their faces with the unformed yolk,</div>
<div class="p">Which must stand for a former mother's grief,</div>
<div class="p">As they propitiate the great god Moloch.</div>
