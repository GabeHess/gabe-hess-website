I"Ý <div class="p">The sun bestowed a pallid light,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dogs whimpered at the moon,</div>
<div class="p">The greater bear had taken fright:</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He dove to hide the bruin;</div>
<div class="p">The stars unsteady in their course</div>
<div class="p">Still sputtering with a feeble force.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The whispers of the gods that died</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the ear of man</div>
<div class="p">No more could sense to man confide</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than move upon their plan</div>
<div class="p">An ear packed most ingeniously</div>
<div class="p">With cotton stuff and sophistry.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The perfumed atmospheres close round</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighed heavy on a boy,</div>
<div class="p">Until his cheeks with roses bound</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So greatly did annoy</div>
<div class="p">That roses withered in his cheeks</div>
<div class="p">And now the rot-o'-roses reeks.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The boy a lusty tune had sung,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till opening his throat</div>
<div class="p">A feeble cough-cough racked his lung,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sore on a passing mote.</div>
<div class="p">He importuned what gods may be</div>
<div class="p">But doubted that they heard his plea.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He thought the world was awful dull,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With nowhere to take flight,</div>
<div class="p">For every open space was null</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every chamber tight.</div>
<div class="p">In short he wandered all about</div>
<div class="p">And wondered, 'What's it all about?'</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He sought the answer in the crowd</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But found them all at feed;</div>
<div class="p">Then going to an elder bowed</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who offered him a deed.</div>
<div class="p">Nor food nor contract sated him:</div>
<div class="p">The elder said it was a whim.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He sunk in sense, he rose in passion,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bobbed in Mother Nature's arms,</div>
<div class="p">Grew sullen, was a man of fashion,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saved a bug and several worms.</div>
<div class="p">He cleared his mind, but empty bliss</div>
<div class="p">Is emptier than the abyss.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He dwelt within a petty sloth,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But never deeps profound,</div>
<div class="p">Though fire-light will allure a moth,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could e'er too deeply sound.</div>
<div class="p">He mightily strained and with a yell</div>
<div class="p">He struck the earth and opened Hell.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then that Dominion sent a soul,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With every devilish grace</div>
<div class="p">That aids a devil on parole</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Writ all across its face;</div>
<div class="p">In mien insinuating, eye,</div>
<div class="p">Air, conduct, and vexatious sigh.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He wheezed a little, then he spoke</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus: 'See the world, my boy?</div>
<div class="p">Conceit and vanityâ€”a jokeâ€”</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With puppet, pawn, and toy.</div>
<div class="p">Come hitch your coupler to the cause,</div>
<div class="p">Come join your name, the engine draws.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">'For Heav'n, though closed to us, our kind</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May rapidly descend,</div>
<div class="p">That Heav'n on Earth may be enshrined</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all to worship bend.</div>
<div class="p">Then man exalts the Glory; throngs</div>
<div class="p">In numbers massing, he belongs.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">'What pale gem shines in this world's foil</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That can suffice for pay</div>
<div class="p">To recompense if angels spoil</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My over-conquering day?</div>
<div class="p">Enjoy your paper-life bourgeoisâ€”</div>
<div class="p">Or light it with a coup d'etat!'</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">His French was bad, his manner worse,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy, however, glowed;</div>
<div class="p">The devil, flying on his course,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his superiors crowed:</div>
<div class="p">'I have the boy, as netted fish</div>
<div class="p">Drop few scales and become a dish.'</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The pulsing rhythm of the skies</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beat strong through the boy's heart,</div>
<div class="p">As foot in beat and flashing eyes</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stepped and flashed with the part;</div>
<div class="p">The swelling part became the whole,</div>
<div class="p">The mob became the boy's whole soul.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">With automatic cries he spoke</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like every other kid,</div>
<div class="p">With vulgar here and there baroque</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tongue flapping loose, he did.</div>
<div class="p">Young fighters pace, their peers among,</div>
<div class="p">So tall, so tall, and yet so young.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He swelled his throat; that pompous sac</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then caught a hitch and shrank,</div>
<div class="p">Deflating at a thought's attack</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or some angelic crank,</div>
<div class="p">Which whispered, This fool's lantern's pale,</div>
<div class="p">More as that chamber did exhale.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">The boy sank, disillusioned; he</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more could join the mob,</div>
<div class="p">For pharisaic piety</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more could do the job,</div>
<div class="p">And swell his breast with noble passion,</div>
<div class="p">And dress his crest with current fashion.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He cast despairing for the sun</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But found a cloudy mass</div>
<div class="p">Made multiplicity of one,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus breaking light, alas.</div>
<div class="p">With mind more roily than the clouds</div>
<div class="p">He rose and fled the ranting crowds.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He sought the shadow, but no light</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is greater in decline;</div>
<div class="p">A moonbeam, but the scourge of night</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is brighter every time.</div>
<div class="p">A parting in the clouds scarce seen</div>
<div class="p">Let fall a sun's ray through that screen.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Then lo! they parted, and the sun</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ascended suddenly,</div>
<div class="p">And high, and bright, and hot, and one</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commanded piety.</div>
<div class="p">He knelt and worshiped, with head bowed;</div>
<div class="p">The rays so shone, his eyes were cowed.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">He felt an impulse dragging him</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To where he could not tell;</div>
<div class="p">(He knew one thing, it was no whim,</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not the road to Hell).</div>
<div class="p">He mused, he could not but obey,</div>
<div class="p">Then effloresced into the day.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Forth from the night he staidly steppedâ€”</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was by a path unknown;</div>
<div class="p">He only knew the sun yclept</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave way to one that shone.</div>
<div class="p">The rest, I never shall relate:</div>
<div class="p">Then save it for a later date.</div>
