I"œ<div class="p">A figure gray, grandfatherly appears</div>
<div class="p">On his home's stoop in humble Scranton-town;</div>
<div class="p">His kindly face is washed with his pat tears,</div>
<div class="p">And manly vigor, too, implies renown;</div>
<div class="p">For Caesar never so humanely wept,</div>
<div class="p">Nor had so firm a stance on Egypt's shores,</div>
<div class="p">As has this President-Elect yclept</div>
<div class="p">Though far from fame, courts, and imperial wars.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though in the dusk of life, he faces dawn,</div>
<div class="p">And light soft beams illumine his pale face,</div>
<div class="p">Till with insufferable content a yawn</div>
<div class="p">Flashes across it at a rapid pace.</div>
<div class="p">Then Champ, his Shepherd, bounds nigh from within,</div>
<div class="p">With frisky morning temper, down the stairs,</div>
<div class="p">And Iosef's face abounds with sudden grin,</div>
<div class="p">With virtuous effect on all his cares.</div>
<div class="p">"Here boy!" he cries, "good boy!" and ends with, "yah,"</div>
<div class="p">Then growls (a moment) and gives playful chase;</div>
<div class="p">He lithely springs from Dover to Artois,</div>
<div class="p">And thunders down the yard at mighty pace.</div>
<div class="p">The frisking German leads him on a romp;</div>
<div class="p">They tumble in the grass, and make small sounds,</div>
<div class="p">Small loving sounds, as man will do with Champ,</div>
<div class="p">And other creatures from the race of hounds:</div>
<div class="p">Heroic contest, in the Scranton grass,</div>
<div class="p">'Tween this First-Hound-Elect and party hack!</div>
<div class="p">But as all good must end, this too, alas!</div>
<div class="p">For hear the sudden, stillness-shattering <em>crack</em>!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A flask is emptied of its colored stuff,</div>
<div class="p">So too the face of Iosef is drained free,</div>
<div class="p">For in their tussle they had played too rough;</div>
<div class="p">And see th' advantage of grave dignity!</div>
<div class="p">His predecessor sighs, and says, 'tis so:</div>
<div class="p">Comport yourself, my man, with worthy pride,</div>
<div class="p">Nor e'er demean yourself in grass below,</div>
<div class="p">Nor have it ever I a word denied.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <em>crack</em> heard round the nation breeds concern,</div>
<div class="p">And some must ask of Champâ€”are his bones sound?</div>
<div class="p">For as the planet's monstrous mighty learn,</div>
<div class="p">Old Iosef is a man of strength profound!</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Laid up from battle, shivering, pale, and weak,</div>
<div class="p">But brave, he would address the nation soon,</div>
<div class="p">And casts from his sickbed in words oblique</div>
<div class="p">The sober hap of the black day's forenoon.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With lauds and worry the obsequious state</div>
<div class="p">Expresses flowering of a newborn love,</div>
<div class="p">As with the bone of battle in his gait,</div>
<div class="p">He hides the story of the fateful shove!</div>
<div class="p">He veils the story of his trip or fall,</div>
<div class="p">Encounter with the physical world's putsch,</div>
<div class="p">Mysterious foot-fracture (night's cabal),</div>
<div class="p">Or his Vice-President-Elect's fell push!</div>
<div class="p">A woeful story: but the road to health,</div>
<div class="p">And former vigor stretches to the fore,</div>
<div class="p">And stick-armed night marauders, or a wealth</div>
<div class="p">Of canines cannot keep our jobs onshore!</div>
