I"‚<div class="p">A pinball ticking off the walls of its small course</div>
<div class="p">With maddened insubordination seeks pride's height,</div>
<div class="p">But rolls home to becalmed humility, perforce,</div>
<div class="p">As thus disposed to heal there by resistless Might.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">So dashing through the thick and thin of this vain life,</div>
<div class="p">And bruised by each encounter, but with healing bruise,</div>
<div class="p">Then resting in a healing way that follows strife,</div>
<div class="p">I in a dark night sit and with my hot head muse.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">Dragged roughly, both with willing step and impulse back,</div>
<div class="p">To Rome, am I. And made to kneel at altar's foot,</div>
<div class="p">Where tame and patient to humility's attack,</div>
<div class="p">I take Communion, praise God, and am scourged with soot.</div>
