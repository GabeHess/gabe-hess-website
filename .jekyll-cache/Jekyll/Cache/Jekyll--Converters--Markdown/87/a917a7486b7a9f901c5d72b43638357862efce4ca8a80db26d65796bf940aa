I"<div class="p">Stood on a pebbled beach a lone</div>
<div class="p">Sky-piercing figure, who was I:</div>
<div class="p">His eyes across the lake gazed far,</div>
<div class="p">Nor took the saturn sky.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He pondered by the vast abode</div>
<div class="p">Of memory who went before,</div>
<div class="p">And stood there as he stood, and gazed</div>
<div class="p">Into the water-halls of lore;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">What tragic lovers rough and white</div>
<div class="p">Of claspèd hand rose o'er the bank,</div>
<div class="p">And parted by the wilderness</div>
<div class="p">Of history that sank;</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">What lovesick artist on that spot</div>
<div class="p">Preferred egress into the flux;</div>
<div class="p">Religious eremite there stood,</div>
<div class="p">Soul wedded to the Crux:</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Their stories wrought into the deep,</div>
<div class="p">And roiling up in smoke-blue clouds</div>
<div class="p">And copper billows, while the breeze</div>
<div class="p">Blew like all ancient shrouds.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Serene expression of the dead</div>
<div class="p">Betrayed his still communion with</div>
<div class="p">The crypt of patriarchs, the tomb of time,</div>
<div class="p">The sepulcher of myth.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The flood more, more the lakeside lapped:</div>
<div class="p">He stood unmoving, till all time</div>
<div class="p">Washed over his lone vigil post,</div>
<div class="p">And spoused him to that clime.</div>
