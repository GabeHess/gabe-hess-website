I"™<div class="p">A stone was set to mark the time</div>
<div class="p">When life was loved for being there,</div>
<div class="p">When reason not nor fickle rhyme</div>
<div class="p">Could give man reason to despair;</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">To cry aloud, "I am but naught,</div>
<div class="p">A nothing bound to nothing, thus</div>
<div class="p">Producing nothing but a mound,</div>
<div class="p">A smiling heap of stately fuss."</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">A time there was when Glory reigned,</div>
<div class="p">When men proclaimed their love of He</div>
<div class="p">Who lived to die for pride and sin</div>
<div class="p">And praised faith, hope, and charity.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">That time is gone and in its place</div>
<div class="p">Is commerce, tech, and stooping pawn</div>
<div class="p">Kneeling at the shrine of Gates</div>
<div class="p">And greeting life with grasping yawn.</div>
