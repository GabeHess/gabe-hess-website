I"·<div class="p">A bubble in a wintry pressing</div>
<div class="p">Like wiggle-room won by a blessing</div>
<div class="p">Grew swollen to ripeness in the clutch</div>
<div class="p">Of frosts unfurling through the land,</div>
<div class="p">Pressing like waters on the Dutch,</div>
<div class="p">Or the steady closing of a hand.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">It wanted proper time for aging,</div>
<div class="p">As all around the winter caging</div>
<div class="p">Felt for weakness in its soap-skin,</div>
<div class="p">Thin ice to lance with an icy pin;</div>
<div class="p">Found none; but the bubble filled with breath</div>
<div class="p">Then smoked away to the chamber's death.</div>
