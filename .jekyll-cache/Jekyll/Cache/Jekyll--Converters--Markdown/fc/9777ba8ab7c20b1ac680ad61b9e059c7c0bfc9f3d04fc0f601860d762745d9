I"A<div class="p">Perhaps a model of the world, the shriveled peppercorn,</div>
<div class="p">As dry, so shrunken, as a head by Shuar people torn</div>
<div class="p">From shoulders of a warrior of a rival tribe, and kept</div>
<div class="p">In puckered form from wrath to guard the civil cult yclept.</div>
<div class="p">The earth as crock'ry in a game of cosmic, amateur,</div>
<div class="p">Advent'rous marbles shot or slung by the contentious spur</div>
<div class="p">Of motion in the universe, of animates therein,</div>
<div class="p">Which otherwise had trickled from a mindless, roiling din;</div>
<div class="p">The earth assumes a fix√®d course, the gyring handle of</div>
<div class="p">A peppermill, though innocent of anger, pride, nor love,</div>
<div class="p">Yet laying carnage on itself; in semblance of a jest</div>
<div class="p">It grinds apart to severed crumbs upon its own behest.</div>
<div class="p">The earth, the breeding ground of strife, the while, as it whirls</div>
<div class="p">In ordered revolution makes a bed for lusted pearls,</div>
<div class="p">And all the revolutions of ambitious dilettantes;</div>
<div class="p">The flag, the colors, pomp and stuff, parade, and civic flaunts,</div>
<div class="p">Which harmony though being still are standards of decay;</div>
<div class="p">Which 'bodied order, still contrive all order to dismay.</div>
<div class="p">Man, bringing order, brings disorder, wracking what he'd wrought,</div>
<div class="p">The law, the custom forth wherefore from jungles he had fought.</div>
<div class="p">With instruments begat for the contrivance of a state</div>
<div class="p">He seeks the restitution of an automatic fate.</div>
<div class="p">With branches of a tree arisen by the care of man</div>
<div class="p">He'd lash the root, uproot the tree, and dwell where he began.</div>
