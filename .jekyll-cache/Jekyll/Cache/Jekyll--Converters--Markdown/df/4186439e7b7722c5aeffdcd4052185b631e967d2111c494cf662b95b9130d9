I"ù<div class="p">Life within the tumbrilâ€”well may it be</div>
<div class="p">Merry, Gay, eternally Blithe, Carefree:</div>
<div class="p">Singing tuneful songs of a <em>frondeur's</em> bent</div>
<div class="p">(Who dodges the Cross and wandering Tent),</div>
<div class="p">Chanting with revolutionary zeal,</div>
<div class="p">Taking as their supper a peasant's meal,</div>
<div class="p">Forcing worse repast on those round about,</div>
<div class="p">(Happ'ly the laws of tradition they'd flout:</div>
<div class="p">But of this I speak in its proper place),</div>
<div class="p">Rending flesh with the wasp-stung women of Thrace</div>
<div class="p">(Though confined to the cart of their Ã©lan),</div>
<div class="p">Faces distorted, grotesque, strangely wan,</div>
<div class="p">Mocking their Father, His created good,</div>
<div class="p">Over their eyes casting the fearful hood</div>
<div class="p">(Starched and sterilized with pragmatic rules),</div>
<div class="p">Pouring their love into Boeotian pools,</div>
<div class="p">Shredding the books of immutable law,</div>
<div class="p">Lashing order's back till bloody and raw,</div>
<div class="p">Jeering at the man with substantial sense</div>
<div class="p">(As among the few he girds our defense,</div>
<div class="p">That thus omnicolored peril may fall</div>
<div class="p">And the innocent ranks no more appall,</div>
<div class="p">That it may not with guiles and cunning win</div>
<div class="p">Grandly the favor of clan, ilk, or kin),</div>
<div class="p">Cumbering faint pulsations of the heart</div>
<div class="p">(With vice, deception, and discovered art),</div>
<div class="p">Shaking their vessel as that organ quakes</div>
<div class="p">(When its lord from a troubled dream awakes),</div>
<div class="p">Laying bare their skull-like, gap-toothed grins,</div>
<div class="p">Wielding their commercialized voodoo pins,</div>
<div class="p">Hanging their souls on their favorite tree</div>
<div class="p">(That of Texan towns mocking amnesty),</div>
<div class="p">Laughing too at this with thoseâ€”O those!â€”eyes,</div>
<div class="p">Hurling Phrygian caps at dark'ning skies,</div>
<div class="p">These cart-borne fools, so eminently right,</div>
<div class="p">Lead blindly, and need not the gift of sight.</div>
