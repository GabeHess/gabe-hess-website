I"6<div class="p">I see the stars like every other man:</div>
<div class="p">Their glory I sing with no less ecstasy</div>
<div class="p">And in no less ecstatic state of captured love</div>
<div class="p">I coo my captivation to the stars above.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">As constellations of my anguish fan</div>
<div class="p">Flaming love of constellations dextrously,</div>
<div class="p">I should not ever, so Apollo's shrine foretells,</div>
<div class="p">Expect the raining rice or hear the wedding bells.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">The stars were hung before the world began;</div>
<div class="p">The stars must view all mortal love vexedly;</div>
<div class="p">And though my tattered heart might soon erupt and die</div>
<div class="p">The numb and listless stars in unmoved amber lie.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">And so my patriotic love of Pan,</div>
<div class="p">In all its simply pompous complexity,</div>
<div class="p">Must wither and must meet a virgin other love:</div>
<div class="p">The glory of the rich and simple Father, Son, and Dove.</div>
