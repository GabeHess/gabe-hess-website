I"ù<div class="p">The occasional foray into public parts,</div>
<div class="p">Where all men root for faces, names, and hearts,</div>
<div class="p">And go ground-feeding on the plants of soil</div>
<div class="p">That soon reward but never bless their toil,</div>
<div class="p">Gives to my stomach an amazing tack,</div>
<div class="p">And I land retching on my very back.</div>
<div class="p">For home and family nourish by the roots</div>
<div class="p">Their more attractive little tender shoots</div>
<div class="p">Of fellow mirth, solicitude, most joys,</div>
<div class="p">Truth, comfort, quietness, and raucous noise,</div>
<div class="p">The earnest conversations; while bad soil</div>
<div class="p">With foreign faces might my good will spoil.</div>
