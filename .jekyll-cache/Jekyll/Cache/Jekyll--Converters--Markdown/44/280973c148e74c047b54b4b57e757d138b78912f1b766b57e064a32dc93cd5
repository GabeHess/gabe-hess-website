I"¤<div class="p">The farmer, flame-like, is capped by an eddy of wind,</div>
<div class="p">An ethereal bobbin, spun by a silk thread.</div>
<div class="p">Aspersions of heavenly spume gather in a whirl;</div>
<div class="p">Infinite winds whirl dizzily round, descending,</div>
<div class="p">In strife-bounded enclave to seal the farmer with wind.</div>
<div class="p">He is wrapped in a bare tranquility of dread,</div>
<div class="p">Somehow made peaceful, as round about the heavens birl,</div>
<div class="p">Till they burst the aether, by once more ascending.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">So, caught in a like suspension of breath I stand,</div>
<div class="p">Held by walls of noise and chatter, yet all is silence,</div>
<div class="p">By ramparts of motion, yet all is silent and still.</div>
<div class="p">A welkin spangled with stains of rust, like passions</div>
<div class="p">On Jove of storm-red dust, shifting like sand on sand,</div>
<div class="p">For my lonely cloister is a roof formed of violence.</div>
<div class="p">I am sober, caught numb in the valley of a thrill,</div>
<div class="p">As waves break round and subside, founding the hour's new fashions.</div>
