I"D<div class="p">As single drops fall past my window</div>
<div class="p">The margin strikes as queer:</div>
<div class="p">The rounded teardrop, falling, Falling,</div>
<div class="p">Against his brother, blending, Streaking,</div>
<div class="p">But for Falling O how drear!</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">Again, the drops that hang and quiver</div>
<div class="p">In some strange way defy</div>
<div class="p">The bleary backdrop, Fading, fading,</div>
<div class="p">Then from the ashes reappearing,</div>
<div class="p">E'er afraid to meet the eye.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">But still the picture comprehensive</div>
<div class="p">For all it lacks it calls</div>
<div class="p">The onward-moving, never-ceasing,</div>
<div class="p">Consuming, always all-consuming</div>
<div class="p">Thinking mind, his lord enthralls.</div>
