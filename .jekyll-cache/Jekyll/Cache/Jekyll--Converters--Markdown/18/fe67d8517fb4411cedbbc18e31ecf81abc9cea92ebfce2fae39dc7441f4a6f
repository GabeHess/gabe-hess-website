I"<div class="p">The firmament of virtues seats a star</div>
<div class="p">That with more beauty blinks into the night,</div>
<div class="p">And gives a light when foemen near and far,</div>
<div class="p">And fellows too, press man upon his plight.</div>
<div class="p">Rich mellow courage like a butter star</div>
<div class="p">Lends bone and strength to bear the uncontrite,</div>
<div class="p">And gains a tint of red for bloody war,</div>
<div class="p">A blueish tint for gloom, or infant white.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">In the dark hour, man courts the influence</div>
<div class="p">Of sole salvation piercing through the gloom,</div>
<div class="p">And at the point of strain, of confluence,</div>
<div class="p">When judgment hangs and quakes from skirts of doom,</div>
<div class="p">His faith in his brave star and providence</div>
<div class="p">Support embattled virtue's elfin bloom,</div>
<div class="p">Which peeps into the vast of vague pretense,</div>
<div class="p">And wink on him like stars seen from a tomb.</div>
