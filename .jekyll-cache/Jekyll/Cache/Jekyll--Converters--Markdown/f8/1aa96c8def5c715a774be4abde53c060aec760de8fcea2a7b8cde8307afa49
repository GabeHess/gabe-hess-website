I"<div class="p">The Crocus blooms and holds the dainty cup</div>
<div class="p">Of life forever blooming and burgeoning anew.</div>
<div class="p">From the life-bestowing soil she rises, always up,</div>
<div class="p">And drifters gather round to kneel in nature's pew.</div>
<div class="p">The Spring hath come, she cries with quiet glee:</div>
<div class="p">The winking face of Jove's sweet earth flowers once again;</div>
<div class="p">Soon will come the Butterfly and Bee</div>
<div class="p">Singing in praise of Love and Love's elated pen.</div>
<div class="p">But still the soil, he sleeps in feathered snow;</div>
<div class="p">And though all yet remains as dormant and as bleak,</div>
<div class="p">No flurried guise can veil the work of heaven's hoe,</div>
<div class="p">Nor hide the kingdom of the heir: the meek.</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there! the crocus bloomsâ€”a splendid sight;</div>
<div class="p">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a glance perceives the garden garbed in white.</div>
