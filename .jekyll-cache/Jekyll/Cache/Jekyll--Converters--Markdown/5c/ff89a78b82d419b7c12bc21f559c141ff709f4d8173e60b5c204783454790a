<div class="p">And dove for tasty grass,</div>
<div class="p">But rose with a full bill of muck</div>

<div class="p">He fawned upon a mother bear,</div>

<div class="p">He melted into noontide tears</div>
<div class="p">That blessed the ancient head</div>
<div class="p">Of an embowerèd owl, whose fierce</div>
<div class="p">Beak spattered him with red.</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="p">He groveled like a sycophant</div>
<div class="p">Before palatial might,</div>
<div class="p">Which—brimstone!—housed a female ant:</div>
<div class="p">A very crazing sight.</div>

<div class="p">And when his skin began to tear</div>
<div class="p">Took pains to quit its paws!</div>
