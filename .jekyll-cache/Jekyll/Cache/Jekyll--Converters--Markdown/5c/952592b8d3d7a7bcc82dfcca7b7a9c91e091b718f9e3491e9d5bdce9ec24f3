I"Ý<div class="p">Why must the clocks all tick</div>
<div class="p">In such a dreary way?</div>
<div class="p">And why are writers round the globe</div>
<div class="p">So seemingly inclined</div>
<div class="p">To use the ticking clock to say</div>
<div class="p">That time is wont to pass away?</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">It's not that I object</div>
<div class="p">To metaphor or simile,</div>
<div class="p">But all things (as we are informed)</div>
<div class="p">Of earthly origin</div>
<div class="p">Must die, as any fool can see,</div>
<div class="p">And some day soon must cease to be.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">It's not that I object</div>
<div class="p">To well-wrought speech in figures clad,</div>
<div class="p">But when those figures are abused</div>
<div class="p">By blatant overuse,</div>
<div class="p">I cannot help but think them mad</div>
<div class="p">Who'd freeze his ticking clock, that fad.</div>
<p>Â </p>
<div class="p">I simply cannot see</div>
<div class="p">The sense in ticking clocks</div>
<div class="p">That never know their time is up,</div>
<div class="p">Allotted and ordained</div>
<div class="p">By God and writers by the flocks</div>
<div class="p">Who drop them from their pens like rocks.</div>
