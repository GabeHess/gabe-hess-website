<div class="p">The great clouds stir with godlike, stately pace,</div>
<div class="p">The wind plays tunes across my upturned face,</div>
<div class="p">The waters ripple for as far as the eye can see,</div>
<div class="p">And God will hear and grant my more than human plea.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Ecstatic with the impulse, I withdraw my sight,</div>
<div class="p">And turn to find all fast becoming night,</div>
<div class="p">A steeple rises o'er the bricky, urban street,</div>
<div class="p">And soft oblivion folds me to her bosom sweet.</div>
