<div class="p">With pace too even to observe,</div>
<div class="p">In plunging down the chute,</div>
<div class="p">Our stubborn England! stopped to swerve</div>
<div class="p">Not, hither for the foot.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Wild France bred venomous Voltaire,</div>
<div class="p">The Devil's Diderot,</div>
<div class="p">A host of atheists, despair,</div>
<div class="p">Iconoclasts, Rousseau,</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Whose fatal words on huge winds swept</div>
<div class="p">The Continent all o'er;</div>
<div class="p">Till sensitive, strong Germans wept,</div>
<div class="p">And begged for more and more.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">The Revolution's civil wars</div>
<div class="p">Broke out, a boil in France,</div>
<div class="p">Whose stuff soon spread to other shores</div>
<div class="p">When pierced by Bony's lance.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">No less than France sophistical,</div>
<div class="p">Pale gnostic Germany,</div>
<div class="p">Its doctrines flung beyond recall,</div>
<div class="p">Which took root o'er the sea.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">America less fleet than all</div>
<div class="p">Descends unto the foot,</div>
<div class="p">And is vexed and torn, from Goose to Wall,</div>
<div class="p">By discord's peeping shoot.</div>
