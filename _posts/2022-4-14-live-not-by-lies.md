<div class="p">Though all the world its head has lost,</div>
<div class="p">And skies are spread with marmalade,</div>
<div class="p">And clouds instead are spread on toast,</div>
<div class="p">I'll call a spade a spade.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Though every star's a twinkle-berry,</div>
<div class="p">And the sun's a lollipop,</div>
<div class="p">I'll never recognize the fairy</div>
<div class="p">At the candy shop.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Though dead is Punxsutawney Phil,</div>
<div class="p">Sir Boogiewoogie in his place—</div>
<div class="p">Impostor—ha! say what they will,</div>
<div class="p">I'll pull an ugly face.</div>
&nbsp;
<div class="p">Though swarms of flies upon the breeze</div>
<div class="p">Ascend into the jelly sky,</div>
<div class="p">And all the phony god believe,</div>
<div class="p">I will not lie.</div>
