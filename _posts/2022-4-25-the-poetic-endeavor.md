<div class="p">Known to the sun who sees the span of earth</div>
<div class="p">From high, is every species inked, and all</div>
<div class="p">Of sundry writ through its career from birth</div>
<div class="p">To death, is marked by ever-during Sol.</div>
<div class="p">All newness has been tried, all withers dead,</div>
<div class="p">The sun at best espies life through chinked gloom,</div>
<div class="p">And every line of verse your poet read</div>
<div class="p">Was laughed, as written, to the floor and broom:</div>
<div class="p">Trite verse, eccentric personality,</div>
<div class="p">The ugly or the stated beautiful,</div>
<div class="p">The rose or the hibiscus, piety,</div>
<div class="p">Iconoclasmâ€”the menagerie whole:</div>
<div class="p">And rhyme of strength and sweetness, truth and beauty,</div>
<div class="p">Fills volumes rotting for the want of use.</div>
<div class="p">"Since all's been written, then," I said, "what booty</div>
<div class="p">Remains for my employment or abuse?</div>
<div class="p">Would I add characters to the great tome?"</div>
<div class="p">I wondered. Then once more the thought I clomb:</div>
<div class="p">"Whatever's pleasing in my Father's sight,</div>
<div class="p">It pleases me, and it becomes, to write."</div>
