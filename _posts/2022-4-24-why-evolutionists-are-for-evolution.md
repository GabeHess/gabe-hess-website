The premise of this essay is that it is useful to explain any fact which might constitute a minor obstacle to the truth. Some people, for instance, are shaken by the fact that some professional scientists are able to deny the faculties that are uniquely human with relish. They themselves feel attached to the idea that human beings have a modicum of reason and free will; but when they see that some of the most qualified among us do not care a bit about reason and will, they think that this, perhaps, is the philosophical attitude, and that they are prejudiced in not admitting it. If an explanation can be found as to how these scientists are able to deny reason and will with pleasure rather than pain, a doubt will have been removed, and everyone will be confirmed in the belief that it is natural to feel a defensive loyalty toward these faculties.

The problem is this: some men whose careers consist in the exercise of reason use their reason to refute the proposition that man is a rational animal. Evolutionary biologists insist that evolutionary mechanisms can be found which explain human culture without reference to reason. They say that men believe in God because this belief binds them together, rather than because a God might exist and some have concluded that He does. And, though their findings would call into question their method, they do not seem disturbed by their findings.

This, of course, is the solution to the problem. These scientists use their reason to make the world intelligible. They exercise the very faculties that, through the exercise of those faculties, they deny. In other words, they use their reason to conclude that reason is more limited in scope than had previously been thought. They are not depressed by this limitation of reason, because they are availing themselves of the very thing that they deny. They do not mind making a machine of the human mind, because this reduction is accomplished by extending the faculties of their own mind beyond the limits defined by their theory. Of course they are still limiting themselves unnaturally in restricting inquiry to the natural sciences. They are excluding even themselves from the delights of metaphysics.
